This paper uses individual-level data from the 2012-2015 March Current Population Survey to estimate the CWD as well as the value of statistical injury (VOI) by race and gender. We find male workers command a positive risk premium, and this is higher when they are unionised. We also find a positive risk premium for White unionised workers and a slightly lower risk premium for White males. Like other investigators, we find that nonfatal risk is heterogenous, and its compensation is difficult to estimate using a standard wage equation, even with some smaller subsamples from our dataset that are gender- or race-specific. Our estimates of the VOI show us that male workers who are unionised have the highest VOI, followed by Hispanic union workers, and Black females. This last finding follows from Black females working in jobs that have the highest risk rates compared to White and Hispanic females.  © The Author(s), 2023.

Going beyond descriptive evidence of the differences between immigrants and nationals in terms of wages, we analyse which part of the gross wage is most affected by features that cannot be captured using econometric models. Relying on microdata from the Wage Structure Survey, we divide the total gross wage into two main parts: base wage and wage supplements. Then we decompose the migrant wage gap into the explained and the unexplained terms, using a simple decomposition methodology, the Oaxaca-Blinder model. Our results show that a part of the differences in wage supplements does not seem to be explained by the set of control variables introduced in the model and that this effect is more pronounced when only men are considered. These findings offer a new perspective on the migrant pay gap in Spain and point to the importance of wage-setting practices related to wage supplements in explaining (and widening) the total migrant pay gap in our country.  © The Author(s), 2023.

Since these characteristics are associated with vulnerable workers, we hypothesise that the income distribution in the pandemic era will be polarised compared to the pre-pandemic period. This article compares the pre-COVID income distribution (February 2020) with the one that prevailed just after the hard lockdown (April 2020). Consistent with the hypothesis, the result shows evidence of polarisation. Disaggregating the analysis by worker characteristics, we find that the polarisation was stronger in vulnerable groups. Our decomposition result suggests that, apart from job losses, returns to gender and job characteristics explain the location and shape differences in the COVID-19 era income distribution. Although this analysis only looks at the short-term effect of the pandemic on income distribution, the result suggests that the structure of labour markets in developing countries is not conducive to a future of work where disruptions (or pandemics) may become more frequent.  © The Author(s), 2023.

This pioneering study investigated families’ financial situations following fatal workplace injuries. An online survey explored the impact of post-death financial change on 142 participants from Australia, Canada, the USA, and the UK using a scale from the economic strain model. Half of the participants experienced financial loss, and the proportion struggling financially increased from 24% to 62% after the death. Workers’ compensation claims were made by 74% of participants, but they reported problems with delays, levels of entitlement, and satisfaction with the scheme. Other key sources of assistance were family and friends or support groups and services. Participants who were older, next-of-kin, and partner/spouses were significantly more likely to experience financial loss as were those whose deceased relative worked 51+ hours per week, possibly because the deceased was self-employed or worked significant overtime not covered by compensation settlements. Those experiencing financial loss sought short- and long-term financial help, accessed social security, re-entered the workforce, acquired mental disorders, and experienced declines in physical health, at significantly higher rates than participants without financial loss, and their children developed mental health problems significantly more often. Findings highlight the detrimental, and potentially intergenerational, effects of financial loss on the health and wellbeing of families bereaved by traumatic workplace deaths. Policy issues flowing from the results are discussed, including how this informs wider debates on refashioning regulatory protection.

Studies indicate that many individuals prefer working from home due to fear of contracting the virus at work. However, not all work can be performed from home. Moreover, jobs that are amenable to be performed from home generally pay more, while the ability to WFH will likely increase income inequality. Therefore, we ascertained socio-economic inequalities in ability to WFH among South African employees during the pandemic. We used data from the National Income Dynamics Study-Coronavirus Rapid Mobile Survey, a nationally representative longitudinal survey of South Africans conducted during the pandemic. We found that the ability to WFH was pro-rich (i.e. concentrated on workers in higher socio-economic classes) in all study periods. The results were robust to the use of different ranking variables and varying the age cut-off. There was no gender difference in these inequalities. Casual employment, urban residence, being married/cohabiting, age and household size dampened the degree to which ability to WFH favoured those in higher socio-economic classes. Conversely, being non-African, living in a house/flat and having more education increased the pro-richness of the ability to WFH. This study highlights the significant inequalities associated with ability to WFH, a likely important positive determinant of welfare in the pandemic and post-pandemic periods. Interventions targeted at inequality-enhancing factors such as race, housing and education may be important in lowering these inequalities.

Allowance decisions are influenced by factors at the organisational, group and individual levels. This research examines managers’ allowance decisions on working from home at each of these levels. It compares two qualitative datasets: one exploring managerial attitudes to working from home in 2018 and another dataset collected in mid-2020, as Australia transitioned out of the initial pandemic lockdown. The findings suggest a change in the factors influencing managers’ allowance decisions. We have identified a new factor at the organisational level, in the form of local organisational criteria. At the group level, previous concerns about employee productivity largely vanished, and managers experienced an epiphany that working from home could be productive. At the individual level, a new form of managerial discretion emerged as managers attempted to reassert authority over employees working remotely. These levels intersect, and we conclude that allowance decisions are fluid and not made solely by managers but are the result of the interactions between the organisational, group and individual levels.

The proposed framework provides labour negotiators seeking integrative outcomes with linguistic guidelines and scholars with a tool to analyse bargaining exchanges.

This war has global effects in various dimensions of social life: energy policy, the environmental dimension, the economic sphere, and also the political atmosphere. In each of these dimensions, it poses a threat to sustainable development and the interests of the labour class in Europe. It attempts to change the balance of power in global geopolitics and also proves to be a useful cover for attempts to change the model of relations between employees and the state and business in many European countries. Due to the conflict in Ukraine and the ensuing calls for increased efforts to 'ensure security', Europe has turned towards a war economy in which the interests of the arms industry are more important than the interests of the working classes. The war in Ukraine has proved to be an excellent justification for governments to lower social standards and get rid of the remnants of the welfare state. From this perspective, the atmosphere of the New Cold War becomes a challenge for the labour movement, the global left and all progressive social circles.  © The Author(s), 2023.

When more firms comply with improved labour standards, the industrial relations climate also improves as non-compliance usually causes labour unrest. Using a model built on pooled cross-sectional time-series data from 2008–17, we studied the role of changes in labour unrest and the percentage of skilled workers in the labour force in predicting outward FDI in Taiwan. Per our estimation model, we found the percentage of skilled workers steadily increased as Taiwan maintained improved labour standards. The increase in skilled workers also increased labour costs making it challenging for firms to stay onshore. However, skilled workers helped firms improve productivity, which justified increased labour costs. As a result, firms in Taiwan that complied with labour standards found it less challenging to pay higher wages and stayed onshore.

This framework acknowledges the employer ability to exercise discretion in the setting of wages. The proposed reforms were unlikely to lead to any increase in economic growth through higher labour productivity or employment. Proposed agendas in enterprise bargaining, greenfields agreements and award simplification (as well as union regulation), would principally have reduced labour costs and incomes. In many circumstances, allowing employers to offer lower wages may lead to fewer filled jobs, higher labour turnover and absenteeism and lower employment. The incentive on employers to improve labour productivity may fall. Proposals to more energetically punish wage theft may have had the opposite effects, but these were abandoned by the government despite support from the other parties. In the end, the only part of the reform agenda to pass Parliament concerned changes to the definition and treatment of casual employees, but casual employment grew strongly before the Bill took effect, the crisis the Bill was meant to solve eased before the Bill was passed, and even if successful the changes would have done little to boost labour productivity.

Since World War II rich economies have de-industrialised, shifted to services. Since the 1970s neoclassical economics has come to dominate policy advice. This worldview justifies state interventions when there is remediable market failure, but it ignores irremediable market failure, where its theory says that markets cannot work efficiently (such as where there is joint production or own consumption). Servicisation, this article argues, has increased and is increasing the extent to which neoclassical economics is, in its own terms, ‘knowably ignorant’. This is because, where service provision is subject to irremediable market failure, neoclassical economics, in its own terms, is inapplicable. The GDP [Gross Domestic Product] share of sub-sectors serving diverse human needs, such as aged care and education, is large and rising. Such sub-sectors are dominated by joint production, manifest as diverse outputs (complex and inter-related changes in the welfare of their diverse clients). Setting aside questions of the wider ‘scientific’ validity of neoclassical theory, the article focuses on its assertion that markets cannot generate economically efficient outcomes in such activities. Arguing that the constrained optimisation of its conceptual world cannot happen in the case of joint production and own consumption of service outputs, neoclassical theory reports itself as unable to determine optimal resource allocation, and so by implication cannot fulfil its role as the foundational basis of state economic policy. Yet the literature shows that the coverage of this theoretical result is not publicised – it is ‘knowable’ but not widely known. The article concludes that, as neoclassical economics is foundational to contemporary state policy, both GDP data and neoclassical theory show that it, and markets, are knowably and increasingly inapplicable.

Using 18 waves of data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey and by means of fixed effects estimations, the study identifies how men’s and women’s contributions via paid and unpaid work influences their satisfaction with the financial situation (SWFS) within households. Employment status is used to proxy each partner’s contribution to household resources. The results reveal that paid contributions through full-time employment have a strong role in determining SWFS. This is a source of gender difference because Australian men are much more likely to be engaged in full-time employment than women. Most often, for both men and women, unpaid contributions to household resources (proxied by less than full-time employment) has a detrimental effect on their own SWFS, but smaller effects on their partner’s SWFS. These results imply that gender asymmetry in paid and unpaid contributions to household resources contributes to the reproduction of gender inequalities within Australian households. The results add external validity to the relevance of De Henau and Himmelweit’s (2013) analysis of these issues.

Recognising the great variability in the form and pace of neoliberalisation across institutions and national contexts, the article identifies a set of features and indicators to aid in the comparative assessment of the extent and effect of neoliberal processes at different institutions. The authors use conceptual tools from labour process theory to highlight the ways that neoliberalisation has resulted in academic work that is fragmented, deskilled, intensified, and made subject to greater levels of surveillance, hierarchy, and precarity. In doing so, the authors also demonstrate the importance of combining political economy and Foucauldian approaches to neoliberalism, to highlight the way that external structural conditions and subjective processes combine to create new labour processes to which participants find themselves consenting and actively reproducing.

Contesting this claim, this article undertakes a comparative analysis of the pros and cons of food delivery platform work prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and argues that the freedom of food delivery platform workers is essentially an ‘illusory freedom’. In reality, platform work has only changed mechanisms through which companies can exercise control over labour and evade their employer obligations. As a case, the article examines the illusory freedom of food delivery platform workers associated to Uber Eats in Japan. The collective bargaining efforts of food delivery workers against the excessive control of Uber Eats and the extent of success of these efforts are also examined. The article concludes by discussing the possible factors that have undermined the effectiveness of the collective bargaining efforts of the labour union.

While employment did grow rapidly in 2017–2019, there was little change in labour market flexibility. Against expectations, part-time employment declined as labour relations continued to be administered under path-dependent institutional inertia inherited from previous decades. The prevalence of full-time, dual-earner employment was shaped by the country’s socialist legacy and was reflected in high employment rates and permanent open-ended contracts for both men and women. Analysis also showed that the revised labour law lowered the probability for women with family care responsibilities to be hired. Once hired, they were offered permanent employment albeit with the reduced protections that such contracts now provide. Impacts of the new labour law on shaping what is considered to be ‘men’s work’ and ‘women’s work’ in Lithuania are discussed.

Our study investigates whether this policy has negatively affected workforce employment and income among women in urban areas. Based on the DID (difference-in-differences) method and the Heckman Two-Step Estimation, reliable empirical evidence shows that the universal two-child policy has significantly reduced women’s employment by 4.06% and decreased their labour income by 10.43%. Surprisingly, this policy has decreased the employment among women under 25 years old by 23.99% and has reduced the income of higher educated females by 29.59%. Furthermore, we find that the influence of the universal two-child policy on female employment has gradually increased from 2016 to 2018, and its impact on income has presented an evident time lag.

In contrast with historical conceptualisations anchored in rights and social security, contemporary Australian social welfare policy discourse is dominated by political representations of the imperative to work. For people currently outside of the labour market, self-reliance through paid work is a primary objective of social security policy. In 2020, economic impacts of national lockdowns were ameliorated by large transfers from the state to businesses and individuals. Concurrent announcements of plans for a 'business-led' post-pandemic economic recovery centred the message that the meaning of work lies in its individual and social utility. Prior to the pandemic, transformation of the modes of organisation of work had already brought into question normative claims about the meaning of work, and what is comprehended by the term 'job'. Analysis of key 'economic recovery' policy initiatives illustrates that they combined considerable corporate welfare with a construction of job seekers as having unrealistic expectations of meaningful work, for which there could be no room in the institutional machinery driving economic recovery. In the policy trajectory of the Australian centaur state, the future of work for people currently unemployed is to serve as a resource to fuel the business-led recovery.  © The Author(s), 2023.

It considers Australia’s industry policy options on the basis of both advances in the theory of industrial policy and recent policy proposals in the Australian context. It draws on recent work from The Australia Institute’s Centre for Future Work examining the prospects for Australian manufacturing renewal in a post-COVID-19 economy, together with other recent work in political economy, economic geography and labour process theory critically evaluating the Fourth Industrial Revolution (i4.0) and its implications for the Australian economy. The aim of the article is to contribute to and further develop the debate about the future of government intervention in manufacturing and industry policy in Australia. Crucially, the argument links the future development of Australian manufacturing with a focus on renewable energy.

As a leading contributor to post-Keynesian theory, he believed a capitalist economy would not create full employment without significant policy intervention. On the labour market, he devised an approach to wage bargaining that integrated fairness with productivity growth in the context of Australia's unique institutions of conciliation and arbitration. On tariff protection, he was agnostic, preferring a more proactive industry policy grounded in post-Keynesian principles and drawing on his early work on accounting theory and practice. His economic advice to the Australian Labor Party (ALP) Committee of Inquiry in 1979 refocused policy debate around the role of incomes policy, which became the centrepiece of the Hawke-Keating Government's Accord with the trade union movement.  © The Author(s), 2023.

First, it highlights structural differences between the advanced market/capitalist economy that forms the theoretical scaffolding of Keynesian theory, as against the diverse range of structural and institutional configurations that characterise contemporary developing economies. Second, bearing these distinctions in mind, how far does the notion of full employment hold relevance in the context of developing economies? Third, the focus shifts to the central Keynesian policy prescription: reflating economic activity through injecting additional demand into the system, in extremis through pump-priming, digging and filling trenches - would this perform in a poor agrarian economy? Would the multiplier work and deliver in the realities of developing economies? Fourth, the central policy agenda in the South was that of launching industrialisation, leading to a sustained structural transformation of the economy - a la the Kaldorian industrialisation paradigm, which is scarcely visible in the (post-)Keynesianism template. Fifth, it queries the investment function and the role of state investment, and/or of animal spirits of capitalist entrepreneurs and agents, whether of domestic or foreign origins. Sixth, there is need to widen the focus, as well argued by Hans Singer, Amiya Bagchi and others, from Keynes-I of The General Theory, to Keynes-II of Bretton Woods, thereby substantially widening the interface with the agenda of development. Finally, there is the inevitable question concerning the nature and role of the state in the contrasting developed-vs-developing-economy, then-and-now scenarios. This discursive commentary is largely a Cambridge dialogue, not inappropriate in a tribute to Geoff Harcourt.  © 2023 The Author(s).","Cambridge post-Keynesian economics; development economics; GC Harcourt; heterodox economics; Keynesian multiplier","","Bagchi A.K., Keynes, Kaldor and Development Economics., (2004); Bagchi A.K., Developing countries: the legacy of Keynes and post-Keynesian economists, Employment and Labour Relations Review, (2023); Bhaduri A., Development and developmental terrorism, Economic and Political Weekly, 42, 7, pp. 552-553, (2007); Bhaduri A., A study in development by dispossession, Cambridge Journal of Economics, 42, 1, pp. 19-31, (2018); Bhaduri A., Patkar M., Industrialisation for the people, by the people, of the people, Economic and Political Weekly, 44, 1, pp. 10-13, (2009); Chakravarty S., Post-Keynesian theorists and the theory of economic development., (1987); Chakravarty S., Singh A., The Desirable Forms of Economic Openness in the South (Unpublished paper), (1988); Cockerill T., Profile: Geoff Harcourt, Cambridge Economics: Cambridge Faculty of Economics Alumni Newsletter, 3, (2010); Dobb M., Full employment and capitalism, Modern Quarterly, 5, 2, pp. 125-135, (1950); Dobb M., Some Aspects of Economic Development., (1951); Griffin K.B., Saith A., Growth and Equality in Rural China., (1981); Harcourt G.C., Two views on development: Austin and Joan Robinson, Cambridge Journal of Economics, 22, 3, pp. 367-377, (1998); Harcourt G.C., Kerr P., After The Accumulation of Capital: defence and development, p. 118-140; and Joan Robinson's views on development economics as political economy, Joan Robinson, pp. 141-164, (2009); Harcourt T., Geoff Harcourt, political economist, 1931-2021, Employment and Labour Relations Review, (2023); Hicks J.R., The Social Framework: An Introduction to Economics., (1960); Kalecki M., The problem of financing of economic development, Indian Economic Review, 2, 3, pp. 1-22, (1955); Kalecki M., Social and economic aspects of intermediate regimes, Essays in the Economic Growth of Socialist and the Mixed Economy, pp. 162-169, (1964); Kalecki M., Selected Essays on the Economic Growth of the Socialist and the Mixed Economy, (1972); Kannan K.P., Raveendran G., From jobless to job-loss growth: gainers and losers during 2012-2018, Economic and Political Weekly, 54, 44, pp. 38-44, (2019); Keynes J.M., The end of laissez-faire.

Whilst innovative production models and their tools provide economic advantage to the company, the interaction of the application of the lean production model within the context of host country institutions often creates workplace disputation and unrest due to unilateralism and managerial hegemonies that overrides local customs and norms. The power of multinational enterprises to override or ignore institutional resistance and to inflict disrespect towards the local workforce can result in worker resistance, a lack of trust, and ongoing industrial unrest. This case study demonstrates how a lack of respect of local customs and workers grievances had long-lasting consequences in terms of the subsequent conflict and a poor industrial relations climate at the production plant in India.  © The Author(s), 2023.

This seems to suggest that the fall in the labour share represents an important constraint on Portuguese economic growth, which is contrary to the orthodox claims around wage restraint policies-namely, that such policies are a necessary condition of improved macroeconomic performance, owing to their positive effects on private investment through higher profits and on net exports through reduced unit labour costs and a corresponding rise in competitiveness. This study assesses the relationship between labour share growth and economic growth by performing a time series econometric analysis focused on Portugal from 1971 to 2021. Findings show that labour share growth has positively impacted on economic growth in Portugal, which is in line with heterodox claims and particularly with post-Keynesian economics on the beneficial effects on private consumption played by the growth of wages. Findings also confirm that the Portuguese economy has followed a wage-led growth regime instead of a profit-led growth regime; that is, a rise in wages increases aggregate demand and, therefore, boosts economic growth because its beneficial effect on private consumption more than compensates for a prejudicial effect on private investment and on net exports. The study points out the urgent need to adopt public policies to support the growth of wages to avoid more decades of dismal growth and a new 'secular stagnation' in Portugal. © The Author(s), 2023.

Based on the European Working Conditions Survey data and on the Job Demand-Control model, which allows for capturing the organisational dimension of jobs, we examine the patterns and evolution of occupations in 22 European countries from 2005 to 2015. Instead of pervasive job polarisation, we observe a near-pervasive trend of upgrading job quality, suggesting that job polarisation may be caused by the undervaluation/devaluation of jobs low in the occupational hierarchy – not by computerisation-driven changes in work tasks. Indeed, only the former can explain the decrease in the number of low-quality jobs while the number of low-paid jobs increases. After documenting the relevance of firm-level organisational choices, we suggest that counteracting job polarisation requires, beyond meso-level collective bargaining, a public intervention that promotes participatory decision-making in firms.

Any carbon mitigation strategy needs to alter our dependence on fossil fuels, requiring a systemic overhaul of its energy mix. Implementing a carbon tax will mitigate emissions and mobilise revenue for our proposed redistributive program: Right to Food, Energy, and Travel (RFET). The policy is designed to advocate for the ‘poor over the rich’ to compensate for the ‘rich hiding behind’ the poor by emitting the majority of carbon and pollutants. Using input–output analysis, we estimate the class-wise distribution of carbon emissions in Delhi.

From a theoretical framework focused on power relations, we analyse by way of a selected case study how the capabilities of companies and their network positions, together with the agency of labour, shape the power relations that influence the evolution of working conditions. The study does indeed find relevant changes to inter-firm relationships, for example, within networks of assemblers and suppliers, but without a consequent re-balancing of power. This finding serves to explain differences in the evolution of working conditions between distinct companies, these conditions being fully functional to a strategy for profitability and thus difficult to reverse.

We compare the two approaches, highlight their implications and assess whether the evidence produced by each is consistent with trickle-down effects. The estimates allow for variations in thresholds, the treatment of housing costs and relative and absolute measures. The findings indicate an overall decline in poverty that is dependent on the treatment of housing costs and a more consistent decline in deprivation but with little or no improvement for many experiencing poverty or deprivation. Poverty and deprivation among unemployed households were above those for people in other labour force states throughout the period and while these differentials have narrowed, the findings suggest that trickle-down effects did not reach many of those highly disadvantaged or are subject to long delays.

It challenges the pro-flexibility literature, which attributes to labour relations reforms the prevention of larger job destruction in the recession and a larger reduction in unemployment during the subsequent expansion. Instead, we examine the role of wage devaluation in the operation of Okun’s law and gross domestic product, using an extended version of the Bhaduri–Marglin model. We find that wage devaluation has not significantly modified Okun’s law and that through its impact on income distribution, the unemployment rate rose by 1.9 percentage points.

Using a sample of listed firms in China, this paper examines the impact of ESOPs on firms’ total factor productivity (TFP), as well as the mechanisms of ESOPs. The empirical results show that ESOPs have a positive impact on firm TFP. The mechanism tests convey that ESOPs increase firm TFP by promoting research and development (R&D) investment and mitigating agency costs. These results are robust after accounting for endogeneity and using alternative metrics of TFP. In addition, we find that the positive effect of ESOPs on firm TFP is more pronounced in non-state-owned firms and firms with a less severe free-riding problem. Furthermore, the effect on firm TFP is positively associated with the subscription proportion of non-executive employees in ESOPs. Overall, the results of this study underscore the important role of employee ownership in firms’ productivity improvement.

Research on these impacts for Australian workers, especially the sociopolitical determinants of effective workplace heat management, remains limited. This article presents findings from a national research project that investigated these issues in collaboration with the Australia-based United Workers Union. It reports on the experiences of members exposed to high heat, explores how they address heat stress and how they relate this to climate change. The article expands understanding of the impacts of workplace heat, especially for indoor workers and those in lower paid jobs, through a focus on how workers articulate their experiences and understand and exercise their agency at work.

Public institutions did not have the necessary resources to support their communities and low-income groups were disproportionally affected by the economic contraction of 2020–2021. This paper explores how the disastrous consequences of the pandemic were exacerbated by the implementation of an austerity programme, that as an extension of a neoliberal ideology, supported the development of the market at the expense of reducing the welfare state. Through an assessment of four trends that were reinforced during austerity—the four ‘Ds’—this article shows that austerity influenced many of the struggles observed during the pandemic. These trends are disinvestment, decentralisation, decollectivisation and disintegration. Despite the lessons learnt in 2020–2021 and the evident need to move away from a neoliberal agenda that dismantled the capacities of the state, this article concludes that neoliberalism continues to threaten the welfare state and the formation of social collectivities. Some expenditure decisions taken by the British government in 2020–2021 could further deepen social class divisions and regional inequalities. More is needed from the government to tackle these social problems and to build a fairer and more equal society.

This study aims to analyse how the closure of kindergartens and schools during the March–May 2020 lockdown in Slovenia changed the reported allocation of time, and perceived emotional exhaustion of parents working from home, compared to nonparents. We also focus on the differences in the impacts of lockdown between genders, status of family-provision and employment sectors of parents. Using data from a survey carried out on cohabiting and married individuals in Slovenia and applying a difference-in-difference estimator, we find that parents incurred a significant increase in their unpaid work burden, reductions in time devoted to paid work and leisure and suffered an increase in emotional exhaustion. Namely, Slovenian parents reported roughly 2 h less of paid and 4 h more of unpaid work per day during the lockdown in comparison to nonparents. The analysis also demonstrates that females performed more unpaid work and enjoyed less leisure before the lockdown, but the lockdown adjustment did not further increase gender inequality.

It examines the available data on the costs of family and domestic violence to employers and the community. It discusses the potential for employers to be affected by Australian State and Territory criminal and related laws that are intended to protect a person from family and domestic violence. Recent cases of discrimination arising from family and domestic violence are considered with some speculations as to other possible forms of liability for employers concerning work health and safety and workers compensation laws. The Australian Fair Work Commission’s determination of unpaid family domestic violence leave is also examined, as is the adoption of paid leave by some State and Territory governments and larger Australian employers. The article concludes with some reflections and speculations on how current laws may affect employers and what actions can be taken by employers to adopt supportive measures to protect employees.

It identifies serious shortcomings relating to the theoretical content and the empirical implementation of existing measures. Based on survey data from European Union countries between 2000 and 2015, it then introduces novel measures of routine task intensity and task complexity at the International Standard Classification of Occupations 1988 two-digit level that address these shortcomings. The indices will contribute to a more theoretically informed understanding of technological change and benefit both labour economists and sociologists in investigating the nature of recent technological change.

Researchers used a qualitative approach to collect and analyse data, drawing on a purposive sampling method to select and distribute open-ended questionnaires to 38 participants. The study established that the alternative dispute resolution (ADR) modes used in Zimbabwe are collective bargaining, conciliation, and arbitration, all formalised and regulated by the Labour Act (2015). Nevertheless, these ADR mechanisms have numerous flaws including, that they are not 'culturally' close to citizens, and as a result, access to justice is still a challenge, they are also expensive and cannot be easily understood by ordinary employees. Accordingly, the study recommends that the government amend the Labour Act (2015) to return to the old conciliation and arbitration system which was decentralised to the districts. When making the amendments to the Labour Act, the government should also consult with general employees and employers, because they are the victims of the current system. Furthermore, workers' committees and trade unions should also be empowered to support and educate employees. © The Author(s), 2023.

In the Australian context, social distancing restrictions and business closures contributed to a dramatic increase in unemployment, with 780,000 people losing work within weeks of the first COVID-19 outbreaks. Job losses were concentrated in casualised industries such as retail, recreation, arts and culture, hospitality, and accommodation. We examine policy discourses framing independent work, entrepreneurial workers and flexible work relations as essential for ‘economic recovery’, where this means business flexibility, productivity and future economic prosperity. We draw on these framings to show how the equation of flexible work relations and productivity underpins the Australian Government’s response to unemployment caused by the pandemic, as reflected in policy announcements and proposed changes to industrial relations law. In these proposals, constructions of ‘job creation’ and ‘economic recovery’ rationalise industrial relations changes that further empower business, through conflating public and business interest. At the same time, ensuing labour market deregulation and the changing profile of business renders the very idea of ‘jobs’ tendentious.

Contrary to the view that these new actors signify the decades-long decline of traditional unions, evidence increasingly highlights their continued relevance to the labour-capital relations of platform capitalism. We argue that dynamic interactions between 'old' and 'new' labour actors in platform capitalism are influenced by national union traditions that emerge more vividly when struggles to re-embed labour relations require the transition to more institutionalised forms of labour resistance. We develop this argument based on a longitudinal qualitative study of labour struggles in the food delivery sector in the city of Bologna, Italy. We pay particular attention to the dynamics of intra-labour actor relations that have unfolded in the sector across different temporally based events of contention in the city. As we illustrate, synergies between the two were prompted by the self-organised workers' need to rely on partners with an 'official' status when re-embedding procedures required; yet, collaboration was also favoured by what we describe as a 'posture of respect' developed by the traditional union vis-à-vis the self-organised informal union, particularly with regard to their quest for autonomy from traditional union structures. We interpret this approach of the established labour actor in line with its traditional orientation as 'class' actor, whose actions look beyond the membership so as to expand solidarity to all workers, including in new productive (platform) sectors.  © 2023 The Author(s).

It also reviews the literature and advances it in four relevant aspects. First, it verifies a general decrease in membership of EAs in Southern Europe, almost to the point of collapse in Greece. Secondly, it identifies the greater importance of large companies (more than Fordist economic sectors) in the composition of this membership. Thirdly, it confirms that sectoral bargaining (as a major determinant) and union representation (an element weakened by reforms) are strong company-level incentives for membership in EAs. Finally, it re-examines the reasons put forward in the scholarly literature to explain why EAs in Southern Europe have not been in favour of these significant institutional changes.  © 2023 The Author(s).

The Green New Deal is a contested political project, with pro-market, right-wing nationalist, Keynesian, democratic socialist and ecosocialist variants. Critiques of the Green New Deal include pragmatic queries as the feasibility of implementation, and theoretical challenges from the right regarding reliance on state forms and from the left regarding efforts to ameliorate capitalism. They also include concerns about technocratic bias and complaints about lack of meaningful consultation with Indigenous peoples on proposals for large-scale shifts in land use.

The difficulties of achieving financial literacy are ill conceived simply as the outcomes of market imperfections. Instead, structural inequalities, financial reform, and the nature of financial assets preclude consumers from achieving adequate levels of financial competence and the claim that they can do so diverts attention from the causes of unequal economic outcomes.  © The Author(s), 2023.

Jindal Global University, India; Nath P., Azim Premji University, India","The introduction of the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) heralded a methodological innovation for the study of Indian labour, allowing the researcher to build panels tracking urban individuals over a year. Using two rounds of the PLFS covering the periods 2017–18 and 2018–19, we construct a pooled panel of urban Indian individuals aged 15–65 and focus on women’s experiences in the labour force. We find evidence of low dynamism in the Indian economy, with women facing significant difficulties regarding labour force participation. While a majority of women remain outside the labour force throughout the year, those who do participate face significant disadvantages. Job-finding rates for women are half that of men, indicating weak demand for women’s labour in the economy. Women face significant exits from both employment and unemployment, with nearly 18% of employed women leaving their jobs and moving to non-participation over the year. Women’s relative disadvantages persist even when age and education are considered, with the lowest job-finding rates seen for young and graduate women, and rates of labour force exit much higher than that of men. This paper highlights the importance of looking at demand side questions when it comes to examining women’s labour force participation. © The Author(s) 2022.","India; labour market transitions; labour mobility; Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS); urban; women’s labour force participation","","Abraham R., Shrivastava A., How comparable are India’s labour market surveys?, The Indian Journal of Labour Economics, 65, 2, pp. 321-346, (2022); Afridi F., Bishnu M., Mahajan K., Gender and mechanization: Evidence from Indian agriculture, American Journal of Agricultural Economics, (2022); Afridi F., Bishnu M., Mahajan K., What determines women’s labour supply?

The reasons why computerisation might increase a firm’s income but reduce the share assigned to wages are still not well understood. The uniquely rich Workplace Employment Relations Survey (WERS) 2004–2011 includes firm-level measures of the main production inputs and outputs, and thus allows an analysis of the main mechanisms through which increased computer usage influenced the wage share of income in UK workplaces over this period. This analysis shows that the proportion of employees using computers impacted the wage share in ways that were at odds with two mainstream views: that computers complement capital, and that labour can be easily replaced by capital. The results show that the proportion of employees using computers reduced the wage share by disproportionally increasing the productivity of the least skilled employees, who were not proportionally compensated for their increase in productivity. The stability of the wage share, over the period of interest, is explained by the rise in a workplace’s share of professional employees and by a rise in work effort. This positive contribution to the wage share was counteracted by an increased share of employees using computers and by a reduction in the share of employees whose pay was negotiated by unions, thereby contributing to a decline in the wage share of firm income.

This article uses China as a case study to show that without addressing the issue of domestic informality, the potential benefits of a Global Green New Deal are less likely to be fully realised in the Global South. We use the Input-Output method and our originally constructed data on formal and informal employment to calculate the informal employment share in two exemplary renewable energy sectors: solar and wind. We find that more than half of the jobs created in the solar and wind energy sectors, with a given level of spending, will be in the informal economy, and hence are associated with low wages and little social welfare protection. The results imply that, without addressing informality, both renewable energy sectors perpetuate the informal structure in the broader economy.

To fill this gap, we report data from the 2019 Special Eurobarometer on undeclared work, which reveals that 30.1% of European workers have higher income from employment than reported to tax authorities. Explicitly, 2.6% of registered dependent employees are entitled to cash top-ups to the official wage, for 7.8% of them the amount of supplementary payments depends on the work efforts, whereas 9.2% receive informal remuneration under multiple arrangements. In addition to these ‘regular recipients’, we also found that 10.5% of employees in the EU can be classified as ‘sporadic quasi-formal workers’. Besides showing that wage underreporting is far more pervasive than previously assumed, the study also offers a more nuanced insight into different manifestations of this illicit practice in the EU. Results of a two-level random intercept multinomial logit model reveal that women are less likely to receive fixed and variable cash-in-hand payments, whereas older individuals have a lower propensity to receive work-time-related income. The analysis also highlights that professionals, service sector employees, manual job workers and individuals whose jobs require travelling are more prone to variable wages compared to the rest of the population. Given a modest success in combating the phenomenon to this date, these findings will be particularly valuable for policymakers in their endeavours to devise tailored policy measures.

With the rapidly increasing importance of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in global production systems since the 1990s, there have been claims of services having developed a growth dynamism similar to manufacturing. This article examines the role of services in India’s growth process using the concept of inter-sectoral linkages to make comparison with the role of manufacturing. Input-Output linkages and time series analysis reveal that services have been much less integrated in India’s production structure than manufacturing. They were also less important in generating indirect employment spillovers through sectoral linkages, compared with manufacturing. Service sector growth is found to be autonomously driven by final demand and therefore less dependent on its interconnections with the rest of the economy from the production side. The findings also indicate that service sector growth has stimulated manufacturing growth but not vice versa. However, the impact of services on manufacturing from the demand-side is neither sustainable nor desirable going forward. India is in urgent need of strategically developing its manufacturing sector through integrating dynamic services like ICT and internalising productivity gains. At the same time measures to address India’s inequality are critical to broaden the country’s demand base and make the growth process more sustainable and inclusive. In this sense, inequality reduction is a prerequisite for growth and should not be seen as an alternative to it.

There is at least one significant difference: at that time, Harcourt highlighted inflation as the outcome of an excess of total demand in real terms over available supplies of goods and services when the potential workforces and existing stocks of capital goods were fully employed. Current inflationary pressures, by contrast, arise from the combination of specific sectoral supply bottlenecks, rising profit margins in oligopolistic global markets for food and fuel and financial speculation in these markets.  © 2023 The Author(s).","developing countries; Harcourt; inflation","","Agarwal K., Lei W.T., Gibbs M., Betting on Hunger': market speculation is contributing to global food insecurity, The Wire, (2022); Bernanke B., The great moderation, Remarks to Eastern Economic Association Annual Meeting, (2004); Bivens J., Corporate Profits Have Contributed Disproportionately to Inflation.

This paper, drawing on primary and secondary data, discusses the various ways in which housing tenure in Australia contributes to wealth and income inequality. It argues that a neoliberal housing policy framework and accompanying financialisation of housing have facilitated a dramatic increase in house prices, the neglect of social housing, and a deepening wealth and income divide based on housing tenure. With respect to wealth, the key divide is between outright homeowners versus low-income private renters and low-income households in mortgage stress. The wealth of outright homeowners has grown substantially in recent decades and many have been able to acquire a holiday home and/or investment properties, thereby intensifying the wealth divide. Approximately a third of Australian households are now locked out of home ownership for an extended period or even lifelong. Housing tenure status also has an impact on the disposable income of households. For example, low-income outright homeowners are invariably in a far better position with respect to disposable income than their counterparts who have large mortgages or are private renters.  © The Author(s), 2023.

If so, how has this come to pass? Why is it increasingly happening? This paper raises some answers based on the Marxist approach. We link employment instability to increased exploitation of the Spanish labour force. This trend is a reaction by capital to low rates of profit and the implementation of particular governmental economic policies implemented to meet the demands of the European Union. Due to the precariousness of work, prospects for achieving a stable and autonomous life for a large cohort of Spain's working youth are seriously threatened.  © The Author(s), 2023.

We put forward a transformative agenda concerned with workforce ageing that aligns with contemporary expectations regarding sustainability, inequality, and emerging conceptualisations of management. In this article, the new concept of Common Good human resource management (HRM) is utilised as a potential means of encouraging business responses focused on grand challenges such as population ageing. We suggest how these principles might be applied to the issue of managing age in workplaces, to recast debate about issues of age and work, to be used as an advocacy tool encouraging employer engagement, while providing a framework that might direct organisational leadership.  © The Author(s), 2023.

We employed the instrumental variable approach to address potential endogeneity issues. While we found no significant causal impact of the Syrian refugees on JVR, they decreased JFR between 2009 and 2018. A reduction in JFR indicates that the Beveridge Curve shifted inwards, thereby raising matching efficiency and facilitating an improvement in labour market conditions. Furthermore, our research indicated differences in coefficients and significance in JVR and JFR across occupations, as well as different effects in these areas between the short and long term. However, the results demonstrate that the rapid and unexpected influx of Syrian refugees alleviated JVR and JFR in most of the occupation groups.  © The Author(s), 2023.

This paper investigates the impact of trade liberalisation on the gender wage gap in China, emphasising the role of sectoral switching costs in driving the effect. Using the local labour market approach as the identification strategy, I find that a one-standard-deviation increase in regional trade exposure is associated with a 3.2% increase in the gender wage gap during the 1992-2009 period. The emergence of the empirical pattern is mainly because the sectoral switching costs are larger for females than males. Since trade liberalisation leads to labour reallocation across sectors, the presence of asymmetric sectoral switching costs thus prevents female workers initially employed in the manufacturing sector from accessing advanced service industries, resulting in a rising gender wage gap after the trade. As a response, female manufacturing workers are forced to either be employed in low-skill service industries or exit the labour market. This paper carries strong implications for policies that both promote gender equity and help trade-displaced workers. © The Author(s), 2023.

How do the historically informed, lived experiences of rural e-commerce entrepreneurs or workers in China help reconceptualize digital labor and platform studies? Deploying the analytic of platformized family production, this article addresses these questions through a deep description of the experiences of variously positioned platform-based and mediated laborers in an e-commerce village in East China. I argue that the ongoing process of platformizing family production is profoundly contradictory. As an alternative to a model of development based on unevenness and the rural-urban divide, village e-commerce has created opportunities for peasants and marginalized urban youth to achieve social mobility. However, it also shapes a new regime of value that privileges the individualized e-commerce entrepreneur as an ideal subject, and fetishizes and instrumentalizes innovation and creativity in conformity with the global intellectual property regime. These tendencies not only contradict the reality of collective labor organization both on e-commerce platforms and in villages, but also conflict with the indispensable role of manual labor in the production process—reinforcing rather than overcoming existing inequalities and stratification in rural China.

He applied his economic analysis in framing policy recommendations targeting the welfare of the poor. He undertook incisive and comprehensive surveys of the work of Cambridge post-Keynesians, some of whom were involved intellectually or practically in the economics of developing economies. Keynes, remaining an imperialist as far as India was concerned, nevertheless produced a corpus which has been immensely helpful in understanding developing economies and prescribing policy solutions for them. First, Keynes created the modern macroeconomics discipline and refined the concept of national income, allowing methods of collecting and organising economic and social data enabling assessment of intersectoral impacts. Second, still relevant today is his idea of an International Clearing Union, disciplining countries with excessive balance of payments surpluses or deficits, even though American opposition at Bretton Woods prevented its adoption. Third, although an economist of the short run, Keynes took up issues of vital concern for the development of an underdeveloped economy, departing from his long-held fears about excessive population growth and contributing to policies for stabilising commodity prices. While Keynes remained a Eurocentric imperialist, his dreams for Europe in general and Britain in particular proved relevant for many developing countries today.

There remains, however, a dearth of knowledge around how driver vulnerabilities are produced and maintained, and which actors drive those. This paper contributes to the discourse by unpacking how the political economy of digital capitalism plays out to undermine the fortunes of ride-hailing drivers in Ghana. Using qualitative interviews and focus group discussions, the paper shows that drivers' vulnerabilities stem primarily from the unbridled control over the means of production, which are the digital platforms and the vehicles, as well as the ensuing unequal power relations between capital owners and drivers as capital producers. The paper also characterises the ambivalent role of the State as a capitalist agent that maintains the status quo, albeit nuanced. The need to interrogate alternatives to augment State regulation is therefore recommended for mediating the relationship between capital owners and drivers as capital producers. Effective alternatives would be reducing capital's monopoly by replacing private, foreign platforms with local public platforms and strengthening drivers' collective agency to mediate the excessive power of the capital owners. © The Author(s), 2023.

Flexible employment has grown both in prevalence and prominence in the study of the American IT industry. What flexibility theorists fail to attend to, however, is the ethnicised demission of the high-velocity labour market in the IT sector. To address this vacancy, the researcher conducted a 13-month ethnography at a leading internet-services firm in the United States and 66 additional interviews with engineers from eight leading tech companies. The ethnographic work showed that inequality that emerged within the tech firms (e.g. ‘bamboo ceilings’) disadvantaged Chinese engineers’ career development. The ‘bamboo ceiling’ stimulated Chinese immigrants to use the high-velocity labour market to normalize their job-hopping practices, in order to circumvent their career disadvantage. To facilitate their job-hopping, Chinese engineers developed university-based networks. This study concludes that, with help of their university network, Chinese immigrants became the most mobile group in the US tech industry, which further preserved the industry’s flexibility.

The Pakistan labour market is known to be ‘traditional’ in the sense that its operations and the attitudes of participants reflect the confluence of various sociological, political, religious, cultural and patriarchal systems. However, the quantitative significance, if any, of overt sexual orientation and its correlation with earnings remains unclear. This study addresses that question.

In 2020, the Australian government convened tripartite bodies to address policy in several areas, one being for agreement-making to cover labour on ‘megaprojects’. This initiative revisited criticisms of unions for driving costs up and productivity down on these worksites, the most expensive of which had been Chevron’s Gorgon site, a liquefied natural gas project off the north-west Australian coast. Drawing on four usually siloed literatures – on industrial relations policy, megaprojects, the economic geography of resources and labour process – this article explains concerns about costs, delays and productivity in terms of project work itself. This approach leads to a different understanding of the merits of changing policy to address megaproject’s problems and productivity more broadly.

Building upon the recent increase in attention to the wage theft problem through advocacy, policy, and research efforts, we contextualise the problem within the country’s deregulated neoliberal labour market. We then propose a conceptual framework to demonstrate how the problem occurs when the price of labour standards violation is low due to lax enforcement, and there is a high price of compliance due to ambiguous and increasingly outdated labour standards. We further evaluate extant federal, state, and local policy initiatives designed to curb wage theft by modernising outdated labour standards and strengthening their enforcement. Finally, we propose future research agendas, such as examining the effects of fissured employment relationships and the enforcement efforts of state and local anti-wage theft laws, to guide the development of effective policy interventions.

The flagship upskilling programme deployed by the government to enhance job readiness and enterprise development capabilities among rural youth has, however, shown mixed results. The slow uptakes of alumni calls into question the adequacy of the programme’s skills composition in resolving the labour market mismatch. Using the Outcome Mapping approach and probit estimation on self-reported skills improvements among programme participants, this study finds perceived improvements in non-technical skills to be associated with a higher likelihood of success in comparison to technical skills, both in securing a stable job and in launching a viable enterprise after completion of the programme. These findings confirm the growing importance of ‘soft skills’ in bolstering employability when jobs are scarce. They suggest the need for a stronger emphasis on this set of skills in upskilling programmes aimed to address unemployment challenges.

In that process, it has, to date, avoided local labour market (LLM) difficulties faced by its subsidiaries in industrial parks in China: in particular, pervasive skill shortages among the electronics assembly workers on whom Samsung's manufacturing depends. Labour retention problems in China had significantly challenged its commitment to invest in necessary employee training. By contrast, Samsung's domination of foreign direct investment (FDI) within particular Vietnamese industrial parks has removed the inter-employer competition it experienced in China. A deeper explanation involves Samsung's development - as Vietnam's largest single source of FDI, and major producer of that country's exports - of synergistic and symbiotic relationships with Vietnam's national and subnational governments. These relationships have allowed Samsung to influence development strategies for industrial parks and their LLMs. Samsung has invests expansively in forms of education and training whose benefits extend beyond the areas in which its manufacturing facilities operate, to populations that the company does not employ. Providing benefits beyond typical success criteria for FDI in developing economies, Samsung has helped Vietnam's party-state meet its own legitimacy needs with its internal constituencies, contributing to a broader practical consensus in favour of the party-state's development policies. This article therefore widens the perspective of FDI to embed it in national and subnational business-government relations.  © The Author(s), 2023.

The paper provides an overview of over 50 current DWFIs in GVCs and asks about the main differences between management-oriented and worker-centred digital feedback infrastructures in their usage of worker data. In the first part, we trace the emergence of DWFIs at the intersection of different trends: the continuous non-improvement of working conditions through auditing, the permanent politicisation, and contestation of this fact through labour and activist networks as well as the development of new digital technologies. In the second section, we elaborate the main features of DWFIs and analyse potential shortcomings in the context of the 'ethical' audit and monitoring regime for GVCs. Third, we use our dataset to present an overview of the heterogeneity of DWFIs. We pay particular attention to examples of civil society developed tools as we suggest that they provide a glimpse of the potential of worker feedback technologies from below, which could contribute to better monitoring of worker rights and facilitate a more democratic coordination of workplaces and GVCs.  © 2023 The Author(s).

Relatedly, Harcourt also made essential contributions to our understanding of how accounting rules, used by real-world businesses to guide their investment decision-making, create anomalies and deficiencies in the accumulation of capital at a microeconomic level - with significant, deleterious consequences for the accumulation of capital at a macroeconomic level. In developing Harcourt's contributions, this paper links Harcourt's early insights about accounting rules with subsequent developments in behavioural economic models of business decision-making, thus aligning Harcourt's contributions with insights from behavioural models of investment decision-making. These insights are then combined in showing how the misapplication of investment appraisal criteria at a microeconomic level contributes to under-investment and investment volatility in the macroeconomy, with negative implications for output, employment, labour productivity, wages and cyclical volatility.  © The Author(s), 2023.

During the period of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Morrison Liberal-National Government’s Workplace Bargaining Policy reinforced this agenda. In place of collective bargaining, APS agency heads were encouraged to determine pay rises and new employment conditions for employees using Section 24 of the Public Service Act (PS Act) 1999. Workplace determinations did not need to be negotiated with public sector unions and some 85,500 employees across 57 APS agencies, or approximately 63% of the APS workforce, had accepted pay increases via workplace determinations by 31 December 2020. The widespread adoption of workplace determinations in the APS poses significant challenges for public sector unions and for the future of APS collective bargaining.

However, this phenomenon has been scarcely studied from a spatial approach. This article uses a spatio-temporal panel data model to examine the spatial interactions between the gender employment gap and, some labour and socioeconomic characteristics of 727 municipalities of Andalusia, Spain, for the period 2012–2016. The results show that due to spatial diffusion mechanisms, a spatial spillover effect occurs in both the gender gap in employment and in some of the labour and socioeconomic characteristics considered. These findings may be extended to other geographic areas and can be of use for the implementation of regional policies aimed at narrowing the gender employment gap.

We argue that conventional neoliberal entrepreneurship discourse conflates empowerment and performativity, linking the capacity of women to develop greater agency with their incorporation into an economic regime with predetermined roles, labelled ‘empowerment’. Applying a critical lens, we analyse the development discourse on entrepreneurship and economic performativity in these terms – looking to understand the characteristics of empowerment concerning home-based workers in Bangladesh working for a fair-trade organisation and a domestic garment supply chain. We argue that the conflation of empowerment and performativity serves the convenience of neoliberal ideology rather than the empowerment needs of those to whom such discourses are applied. To complement our critique, based on the empowerment literature, we develop a conceptual framework of empowerment and agency encompassing individual and collective agency, considering these in light of the relationship between performativity and social reproduction. Coupling a more nuanced understanding of empowerment to the critique of the entrepreneurial discourse, as applied to women home-based workers, provides a theoretical contribution to the empowerment and entrepreneurial discourse literature.

While emerging research is considering implications of these changed governance arrangements at both a school and system level, little attention has been afforded to teacher union responses to devolutionary reform, despite teaching being a highly union-organised profession and the endurance of decentralising-style reforms in education for over 40 years. Drawing upon a power resources approach, this article examines union responses in cases of devolutionary reform in a populous Australian state. Through analysing evolving policy discourse, from anti-bureaucratic, managerialising rhetoric to a ‘post-bureaucratic, empowerment’ agenda, this article contributes to understandings of union power for resisting decentralising, neoliberal policy agendas by exposing the limits of public sector unions mobilising traditional power resources and arguing for strengthening of discursive and symbolic power.

Platform game work encompasses a broad range of online video game services such as live game streaming, paid boosting, and game companion, matching customers' demands to workers who provide entertainment or assist play. Platform game work has drawn an estimated seven million young workers into precarious employment during the past decade. The article outlines three interwoven features defining the fragmented control of platform game work: the crucial function of extra-platform intermediaries in regulating labour processes; the deployment of relationship labour in order matching and community management; and the mutual reinforcement of platform diversity and fast-moving platform architecture. These three features co-create a decentralised yet resilient structure organised by a network of platform and non-platform, human and machine agencies. Positioning platform game work in the broad spectrum of gig work, the article illuminates new modes of labour control and workers' embedded agency, adding to the nascent literature on diverse labour regimes and subjectivities in the platform economy.  © The Author(s), 2023.

An important facet of the discussion is how they should be financed. The negative impacts of Covid-19 on national budgets and sovereign debt question whether the implementation of Green New Deals is feasible if austerity needs to be introduced to achieve sustainability. This article assesses whether a wealth tax based upon the work of Michal Kalecki could help avoid austerity measures and facilitate the introduction of Green New Deals. While wealth taxes have traditionally been defined on net worth or assets to reduce wealth inequality, the formulation is meant to be equitable by applying to gross wealth or assets. Estimates are calculated for the United States and turn out to be quite modest. The approach not only generates revenue to cover expected net interest outlays on national debt, but additional revenue to pay down portions of it and/or support green initiatives, such as Biden’s de-carbonisation policy. The article concludes with a discussion of challenges for the tax’s effectiveness.

This paper argues that the analytical findings of this research effort are an important and integral part of Harcourt's overall research programme. In this paper, we review Harcourt's work on the relation between economics and accounting from the time of his undergraduate thesis to 1969, the date of the publication with Robert Parker of the edited volume Readings in the Concept and Measurement of Income. This paper intends to offer insights on (A) the evolution of Harcourt's thought during this period and a survey of the significant contributions he made to research in this field during this time and (B) the legacy of his approach and findings. We argue that his ideas in this domain offer important insights in doing post-Keynesian economics in the Harcourt mould. We find that Harcourt's insights on the issues relating to the accounting rate of profit as used by economists remain relevant to today, as well as his implicit suggestions on how to deal with the complexities of the problems that ensue for the theorist, practical economist, businessman, and policy advisor. Harcourt's work suggests that we should not aim to replace one monolithic way of seeing things with another, indicating that the useful definition of key concepts and tools is determined by the problem and hence by the policy question one wants to answer.  © The Author(s), 2023.

This crisis comes on top of considerable turmoil for public services in recent decades, with public management reforms followed by the global financial crisis (GFC) leading to considerable change to public sector employment relations and a deprivileging of public servants. The research adopts the lens of the ‘public service bargain’ to examine the effects of the pandemic across Australian public services. How did Australian public service jurisdictions approach public employment in 2020, across senior and other cohorts of employees? How did this pandemic response compare to each jurisdictions’ response to the GFC a decade earlier? The research also reflects more broadly of the impact on public sector employment relations and to what extent pandemic responses have altered concepts of the diminished public service bargain or the notion of governments as model employers?

By employing Elaine Scarry’s concept of ‘language of agency’ and ‘analogical substantiation’, the article first investigates how digital game workers express their work experiences and their embodied pain by analysing the mechanism of ‘crunch’ practice. Second, by examining ‘karoshi (overwork to death)’ and a series of suicides of digital game workers in Korea, it seeks to explore the problem of death as the final form of bodily pain – focusing on how these death events led workers to develop new forms of politics and solidarity by organising labour unions. Finally, by analysing the newly established digital game worker unions’ opposition to the violation of worktime regulation as a ‘struggle for recognition’, this research illuminates how digital game workers not only acquire self-respect but also achieve social recognition for their bodies as working labour. By examining this labour union organisation practice in Korea, the study ultimately argues that recognising the politics of body in digital labour offers the possibility that an emerging social category of precariat can actually co-exist and connect with the existing social class of proletariat.

Focussing on temporality allows to shed light on some aspects of labour mobility that enlighten our understanding of work-related conflicts. Especially with view to labour market inclusion, migrants often experience the (assumed) temporal limitation and unpredictability of migration projects, work and residence permits, as well as employment relationships. Correspondingly, labour policies, sector-specific company structures and management techniques also have a temporal dimension (time limits, seasonality, outsourcing schemes), which have effects on conflicts in and around work. Furthermore, one has to situate labour and labour migration within its context of social reproduction in order to better understand, how paid wage labour is embedded in social activities and networks such as households, families and communities, and shaped by the social, developmental and migratory policies that condition workers' labour market inclusion. This conceptual paper argues that for migrants in particular, the (assumed) temporal limitation and unpredictability of migration projects, work/residence permits, and employment relationships is of great importance when it comes to analysing conflict-ridden negotiations over labour relations and working conditions. © The Author(s), 2023.

A case study of two districts of Madhya Pradesh (MP) state is presented to demonstrate how the living wage benchmarks based on the Anker Methodology compare with existing minimum wage fixations and other development indicators. The living wage benchmarking is based on field surveys conducted in Ratlam and Chhindwara districts in October-December 2021, and a rigorous analysis of nationally representative consumption and expenditure surveys conducted by the National Sample Survey Organisation and the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy. Our living wage estimates are 1.8 times the minimum wages for agricultural labourers and 43% more than those earned by non-agricultural unskilled labourers. Moreover, the actual wages reported are less than half of the estimated living wages, indicating that the current incomes and wages for workers and farmers of rural MP are far from adequate to lead a decent life. © The Author(s), 2023.

It focuses on the politics of policy change and government assistance, providing a detailed historical narrative of the development and decline of the Australian automotive industry. From the mid-1980s to the mid-2010s, policy-makers oversaw the decline and fall of the Australian automotive industry. The process of decline occurred within a long-term cycle of new assistance, declining protection, new investment, inadequate restructuring, weak profitability, declining market share, and new assistance. Each cycle, however, was unable to stave off renewed crisis and eventual demise. Over the same period, Australian policy-makers transformed the economy from one of the most protectionist in the developed world to one of the most open. The article outlines the impact of neoliberalism on the automotive industry and analyses what the decline of the industry tells us about how the neoliberal policy structure operates in the ‘actually existing’ political economy. It argues that while the burgeoning neoliberal policy structure in the 1980s and 1990s acted to restrict the range of policy choices available for restructuring the industry, the domestic politics of industry assistance acted to restrict the neoliberal colonisation of the policy agenda. Neoliberal governance has had to contend with political imperatives for continuing assistance, while, at the same time, those political imperatives have been increasingly shaped by neoliberalism.

It is argued that without taking into account (quasi-)monopsonistic structures of the labour market, wrong predictions are made about the effects of minimum wages. Using switching fractional panel probit regressions with German establishment data, I find that slightly more than 80% of establishments exercise some degree of monopsony power in their demand for low-skilled workers. The outcome suggests that a 1% increase in payments for low-skilled workers would, in these firms, increase employment for this group by 1.12%, while firms without monopsony power reduce the number of low-skilled, by about 1.63% for the same increase in remuneration. The study can probably also be used to explain the limited employment effects of the introduction of a statutory minimum wage in Germany and thus leads to a better understanding of the labour market for low-skilled workers.

However, since the outbreak of that crisis, no such fiscal balance has again been attained, giving rise to a range of explanations from the political incapacity of governments to the weak economic behaviour characterising the post-crisis era. Noteworthy in any case is that analysts have failed to cite the importance of a factor that was key to reaching pre-crisis surpluses: the vertiginous growth of private debt. This work argues that it was precisely the intense granting of bank loans and consequent increased demand from the private sector that boosted economic activity and led to the generation of public income sufficient to feed the fiscal surpluses of that period. Indeed, according to the proposals of Wynne Godley, this would have been the only way to register a public surplus in a context of current account deficits, typical of the Australian economy. This paper considers whether Australian private debt played a significant role in achieving fiscal surplus by way of a review of the Australian real estate boom and public accounts from the 1990s onward, also estimating an econometric model of autoregressive vectors to explore the link between these two variables. The results obtained appear to corroborate the hypothesis: severe private borrowing contributed to Australia’s fiscal surpluses. This finding has significant implications for budgetary policy.

The antecedents and characteristics of early retirement schemes implemented by Australian universities between 2010 and 2020 were considered. Twenty-eight schemes were identified across 20 universities. Content analysis of descriptions of the schemes contained in official documents was undertaken. This revealed somewhat common justifications for the schemes, linked to concerns about organisational sustainability/resilience in the face of external threats and the implementation of modernising efforts. Such justifications appeared to be underpinned by similar ageist biases on the part of management. Despite this broad commonality, however, the schemes manifested a multifurcation of possible work-retirement pathways across institutions. Such reorganisation of labour processes, based on ageist representations that potentially place established workers in conflict with others, represents an incongruence between the market-oriented objectives of universities and areas of public policy responding to workforce ageing. It is argued that drawing momentum from emerging conceptions of sustainability and current diversity initiatives such as Athena Swan and Age Friendly Universities it may be possible to sever the link university leadership perceive between the divestment of older workers and the fulfilment of modernising agendas. © The Author(s) 2022.","Ageism; early retirement; older workers; universities","","Albulescua I., Albulescua M., The university in the community.

A notable barrier is the apprenticeship system, which requires women to overcome obstacles in employment and training. Government and industry stakeholders have encouraged women’s apprenticeships in male-dominated trades through the development of Group Training Organisations’ (GTOs) that operate as intermediaries between apprentices and employers. Extending Acker’s model of workplace inequality regimes, we argue that inequality regimes operate between organisations at an industry-wide level. We ask ‘Do GTOs operate to produce and reproduce workplace and industry-wide inequality regimes? Or can they facilitate improved gender diversity in male-dominated trades?’ Drawing on a recent study of regional tradeswomen’s employment, we find that although GTOs have an important role in facilitating gender diversity, they have inconsistent results in challenging existing inequality regimes. There is a risk that they may become a vector of transmission for workplace inequality regimes to the broader industry.

This article illustrates the impact of COVID-19 on the labour market as well as on living standards in the case of a small open economy: Mauritius. We present descriptive evidence based on a unique set of telephone household surveys, representative of the Mauritian population, conducted between May 2020 and March 2021. We find that women had a higher risk of losing their job and leaving the labour force, reversing a decade-long trend of increasing labour force participation. Low-skill workers in sectors that depend on global demand – and even more so if employed informally – together with women were more likely to be affected by the crisis. One in three households reported a loss in income since the start of the pandemic, and the probability of experiencing this shock increases with the number of household members who lost their job and who were employed informally. From a policy perspective, our findings underscore the negative distributional consequences of the pandemic and provide substantive evidence for the viability of a further proactive policy stance to shield the livelihoods of vulnerable households during the economic recovery phase. © The Author(s) 2022.","Coronavirus; inequality; labour market; Mauritius; recessions","","Adams-Prassl A., Boneva T., Goldin M., Et al., Inequality in the impact of the coronavirus shock: Evidence from real time surveys, Journal of Public Economics, 189, (2020); Bednarzik R., Kern A., Hisnanick J., Displacement and debt—The role of debt in returning to work after displacement, Journal of Financial Economic Policy, 13, 5, pp. 600-650, (2021); Blundell R., Machin S., Self-employment in the Covid-19 crisis, (2020); Cahuc P., Kramarz F., Nevoux S., When short-time work works, (2018); Campello M., Kankanhalli G., Muthukrishnan P., Corporate hiring under COVID-19: Labor market concentration, downskilling, and income inequality, (2020); Castaneda J.L., Gaddis I., Ranzani M., Et al., Supporting Mauritian Youth With Little Education in Their Job Search.

The authors conclude that it is almost certain that under the conditions of post-pandemic capitalism, the number of the precariat will grow and the neoliberal system will want to retain as many of the anti-worker solutions introduced in the shadow of the pandemic as possible.

This article makes use of Job Demands-Resources theory (JD-R) to examine the impact of COVID-19 on nurses’ working conditions in public and private hospitals in Sri Lanka. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, nurses’ job demands on public hospital wards included long working hours, limited workplace autonomy, minimal medical resources and high workloads caused by understaffing. Private hospital nurses experienced pressure from patients and their families to provide them with discounts on medical bills. Nurses allocated to work on COVID-19 wards experienced additional physical job demands from wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) for lengthy periods on hospital wards in a humid climate. Nurses on COVID-19 wards also experienced increased anxiety that they could transmit the disease to family members. While nurses experienced job resources such as social support from nursing supervisors and other nurses, they reported receiving minimal training in the provision of healthcare to COVID-19 patients. This combination of high job demands and low job resources increased the levels of exhaustion and mental distress experienced by many nurses working on COVID-19 hospital wards.

The first generation of the critique has drawn on a variety of Marxist, post-structuralist and Weberian sources to question prevailing neo-liberal and centrist models centred on values of efficiency and the supposed empowerment of workers and users. While these topics, themes and concepts have been beneficial in establishing a basis for critique, there is a danger that they may become rather familiar and potentially even a little stale. Therefore, this article suggests a need to renew the critique of digital labour, as the digital realm stabilises around a set of key global players and platforms and as labour activists continue to face serious obstacles to success in an era of authoritarian populism. Here, I concentrate on introducing our themed collection surrounding a renewed critique moving beyond a dichotomy of exploitation and labour agency. I also encourage different disciplines to enrich and renew studies of digital labour.

It examines how young migrants from rural areas in China engage in Kuaishou as a means of realising upwards socio-economic mobility by producing a tuwei (earthiness) culture which has a large fan base. It also examines the way in which they collaborate to cope with precarious conditions lacking guaranteed working time and income, and labour protection. The article attempts to build a conversation with existing scholarship that addresses the ‘exploitation vs. empowerment’ dialectic of labour production. Instead, we address the complexity of digital labour production characterised by a collaborative and symbiotic relationship between social media platforms and users. Through ‘play’ with their followers that generates profit for the digital platform, migrant youth voluntarily accept the uncertain, unpredictable, and risky conditions of digital labour production. They are, however, not passively subjected to platform exploitation but can instead reclaim agency by actively seeking to collaborate with other users to cope with increasing precariousness.

This article fills the gap by exploring sociocultural dynamics that have emerged in maker culture, such as how makers in China mobilise their agency to struggle for a path forward to achieve decent work and a better society. The article first reviews research on the Chinese maker community as well as digital labour, in particular the dualism of exploitation and workplace resistance in current digital labour research. It argues that makers, in the case studied, mobilise certain agency initiating from sociocultural dynamics beyond the framework of exploitation. The article then explicates the argument with cases collected from our fieldwork in Shenzhen’s maker community in July–August 2017. It shows makers’ practices originating from the open-source ethos, such as an awareness of sharing and mutual support in moulding a ‘micro-innovation’ model, and in creating products that aim to benefit vulnerable communities and build up a sustainable ecosystem. The article thus turns the current economic discussion on maker culture in a new direction: the sociocultural impact of the maker movement. Furthermore, it suggests that this research on the sociocultural impact fills the gap between existing digital labour research and maker studies.

This article outlines research findings from a study examining their experiences at a large Australian university. The article uses a materialist framework to demonstrate how capitalist social relations shape and demarcate an ‘ideal university worker’, how disabled workers find it difficult to meet this norm, and the limited assistance to do so provided by managers and labour relations policy frameworks. The research findings point to a profound policy gap between employer and government disability policy inclusion frameworks and the workplace experience of academics. This breach requires further investigation and, potentially, the development of alternate strategies for workplace management of disabilities if there are to be inroads towards equity. © The Author(s) 2022.","Australia; disability; discrimination; labour; universities","","Reasonable adjustments; Bengtsson S., Out of the frame: Disability and the body in the writings of Karl Marx, Scandinavian Journal of Disability Research, 19, 2, pp. 151-160, (2017); Blackmore P., Prestige in Academic Life: Excellence and Exclusion, (2015); Brandao Dolan V., Faculty narratives of disability in academic work, (2018); Brown N., Conclusion: Disability imaginary of the future, Lived Experiences of Ableism in Academia, pp. 315-322, (2021); Brown N., Leigh J., Ableism in academia: Where are the disabled and ill academics?, Disability & Society, 33, 6, pp. 985-989, (2018); Campbell F.K., The violence of technicism: Ableism as humiliation and degrading treatment, Ableism in Academia: Theorising Experiences of Disabilities and Chronic Illnesses in Higher Education, pp. 202-224, (2020); Connor D.J., Coughlin A.B., Ramping it up: Calling attention to dis/ability at the end of education’s social contract, Disability Politics in a Global Economy: Essays in Honour of Marta Russell, pp. 118-134, (2017); Corlett S., Williams J., The effects of discourse and local organizing practices on disabled academics’ identities, (2011); Davies A.R., Frink B.D., The origins of the ideal worker: The separation of work and home in the United States from the Market Revolution to 1950, Work and Occupations, 41, 1, pp. 18-39, (2014); Deem R., Morley L., Diversity in the academy?

The author analyses the income function of dividend, but also considers its sociological aspects. Talcott Parsons' social system theory is the main point of reference, especially, the concept of contract institution. The article justifies the thesis on the relevance of dividends in shaping the equilibrium of power, information policy and the composition of shareholders in a joint-stock company. Dividend policy has a great regulatory potential, which is important in the face of various crises occurring in contemporary capitalism.

This article explores their experiences in an industry operating under international legislation designed to ensure and maintain their employment and working conditions. Three hundred and fifty-two British seafarers completed an online questionnaire. The findings revealed two key themes: the erosion of the terms and conditions of those who work at sea, and the differing experiences of those who were precariously employed on single voyage contracts in comparison to those in permanent employment. In contrast with precariously employed individuals, more seafarers with permanent contracts were joining the vessel as normal and fewer were not being paid having been unable to join a ship as scheduled. In a similar vein, fewer permanently employed seafarers were adversely financially impacted during the pandemic. The article concludes that those with the weakest employment relationships have experienced the greatest challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic–a scenario which was possible as a result of the limited enforcement of the regulatory framework intended to protect those who work at sea. © The Author(s) 2022.","Precarious work; regulation","","Singapore lockdown highlights plight of migrant workers, (2020); British Airways Faces Strike Threat over Job Cut Plan, (2020); Hundreds Lose Job in British Gas Contracts Row, (2021); Manpower Report, (2015); Che L., Du H., Chan K.W., Unequal pain: a sketch of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on migrants’ employment in China, Eurasian Geography and Economics, 61, 4-5, pp. 448-463, (2020); Seafarers in the UK Shipping Industry: 2019, (2019); Devereux H., The Impact of the Organisation of Work and Employment at Sea on the Occupational Health, Safety and Well-Being of Seafarers (Doctoral Dissertation), (2017); Devereux H., Wadsworth E., Work scheduling and work location control in precarious and ‘permanent’ employment, The Economic and Labour Relations Review, 32, (2020); Graham C.A., Walters D., Representation of seafarers’ occupational safety and health: limits of the maritime labour convention, The Economic and Labour Relations Review, 32, 2, pp. 266-282, (2021); Gray B.J., Kyle R.G., Song J., Et al., Characteristics of Those most vulnerable to employment changes during the COVID-19 pandemic: a nationally representative cross-sectional study in wales, Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health, 76, (2021); Hassink W., Kalb G., Meekes J., The Dutch Labour Market Early on in the COVID-19 Outbreak: Regional Coronavirus Hotspots and the National Lockdown, IZA Discussion Papers, No. 13673, (2020); Hejazi S.H., Seafarer Abandonment: A Human Rights at Sea Perspective from Iran, (2019); Humphreys D., Changes to HGV drivers’ Rules Spark Outrage on Safety Grounds, (2021); Shipping and World Trade: Global Supply and Demand for Seafarers, (2021); Policies and Regulations to Combat Precarious Employment, (2011); Testimonies of Stranded Seafarers, (2020); IMO Welcomes UN Resolution on Keyworker Seafarers, (2020); Jensen H., Cost of Crew Change Skyrockets Due to Pandemic, (2020); Lewchuk W., Precarious jobs: where are they, and how do they affect well-being?, The Economic and Relations, Labour Review, 28, 3, pp. 402-419, (2017); Mantoju C.D., Analysis of impact of the maritime labour convention, 2006: a seafarer’s perspective, Journal of International Maritime Safety, Environmental Affairs, and Shipping, 5, 3, pp. 107-119, (2021); Seafarer Fatigue – Project Horizon, (2013); MGN Maritime Labour Convention 2006 Repatriation, (2014); MIN 632 Covid-19 Extension of Seafarer Employment Agreements, (2020); McGarity T., Duff M.C., Shapiro S.A., Center for Progressive Reform Report: Protecting Workers In A Pandemic–What The Federal Government Should Be Doing (June 17, 2020), (2020); Mishra B., MAJ Warns of Potential Seafarer Shortages If Crew Change Crisis Isn’t Resolved, (2021); Covid-19: UK Government Designates Seafarers as Key Workers, (2020); Nautilus FAQs on Covid-19 Coronavirus, (2021); Oldenburg M., Jensen H.J., Latza U., Et al., Seafaring stressors aboard merchant and passenger ships, International Journal of Public Health, 54, 2, pp. 96-105, (2009); Pauksztat B., Andrei D.M., Grech M.R., Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of seafarers: a comparison using matched samples, Safety Science, 146, (2022); Plush H., The world’s largest cruise ship in numbers, (2016); Quinlan M., Bohle P., Overstretched and unreciprocated commitment: reviewing research on the occupational health and safety effects of downsizing and job insecurity, International Journal of Health Services, 39, 1, pp. 1-44, (2009); Sampson H., Ellis N., Acejo I., Et al., The Working and Living Conditions of Seafarers on Cargo Ships in the Period 2011-2016, (2018); Sampson H., Acejo I., Ellis N., Et al., The Use of Mandatory Equipment on Board Cargo Ships: An Outline Report Based on Research Undertaken in the Period 2012-2016, (2016); Sliskovic A., Seafarers’ well-being in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study, Work, 67, pp. 799-809, (2020); Shan D., Occupational health and safety challenges for maritime key workers in the global COVID-19 pandemic, International Labour Review, (2021); Walters D., The role of the state in achieving compliance with occupational safety and health requirements: Some lessons from the British regulatory response in the time of Covid-19, Diritto Della Sicurezza Sul Lavoro, 1, pp. 118-137, (2021); Walters D., Bailey N., Lives in Peril, (2013); Winchester N., Sampson H., Shelly T., An Analysis of Crewing Levels: Findings from the SIRC Global Labour Market Survey, (2006); Wu B., Winchester N., Crew study of seafarers: a methodological approach to the global labour market for seafarers, Marine Policy, 29, 4, pp. 323-330, (2005)","H.

The production of most trucking services takes places on public roadways, which makes commercial motor vehicle safety a topic of concern for industry stakeholders, supply chain operations, policy makers, and the general public. This study explores the relationship between new employee driver compensation and for-hire interstate truckload motor carrier crash incidence. The results suggest that, all else constant, higher benefits are associated with fewer crashes. While mileage pay rates predict crashes, we find that higher mileage rates can be correlated with either higher or lower crash frequency - depending on the carrier's existing starting pay level. This may be due to pernicious incentives created by piece-rate pay structures, because drivers who have more unpaid non-driving work time may earn a slightly higher mileage pay rate, which only partially compensates them for unpaid labour time. Regardless, these results suggest that compensation is an important predictor of safety and the existing pay practices in the industry may be unsafe. It also suggests that the role of compensation in motor carrier safety performance deserves further exploration with better quality data-especially full documentation of hours of work and pay rates.  © The Author(s), 2023.

This system can be regarded as ‘financialised’ in that retirement savings are primarily managed by non-government financial institutions and, although the Age Pension remains as a safety net, responsibility for the provision and management of retirement incomes has increasingly shifted to individuals. In this article we report the results of a qualitative study of older mixed-sex couple households’ experiences of this system and discuss the implications for retirement incomes policy. We conclude that while the system of government-mandated employer superannuation contributions (the Superannuation Guarantee) is undoubtedly raising the living standard of many older Australians, the financialised nature of the retirement income system, as a whole, poses significant financial risks for many retirees. © The Author(s) 2022.","Australia; financialisation; qualitative methods; retirement","","ASFA Retirement Standard: Detailed budget breakdowns, (2019); Superannuation statistics, June, (2022); Retirement, retirement intensions, Australia, (2018); Royal Commission Into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry, 1, (2019); APRA releases superannuation statistics for June 2022, (2022); Bagshaw E.I., I misread franking credits, says Shorten of election loss, Sydney Morning Herald, (2019); Borowski A., Risky by design: The mandatory private pillar of Australia’s retirement income system, Social Policy and Administration, 47, 6, pp. 749-764, (2013); Brooks S.M., Weaver R.K., Lashed to the mast?

We found that an increase in the ratio of workers aged over 50 years to total workers had a negative effect on value added per worker, which was consistent with the findings of most previous studies based on European data. However, the results of the analysis, including various classifications such as size, industry and several financial conditions, revealed that an increase in the ratio of older workers had positive effects on value added per worker in large manufacturing firms under risky or growing conditions. As the productivity of older workers may vary, future research may determine under what conditions – size, industry, region and financial conditions – older workers contribute positively to productivity. Firms with financial troubles or those planning to downsize should be cautious about laying off older workers as an approach to improving organisational performance because these workers contribute positively to productivity under certain conditions.

Such an examination is rare in the extant literature and it is timely given the increasing debate concerning the stimulus versus inflationary effects arising from wage polices because of COVID-19 global pandemic. We apply the autoregressive distributed lag model to determine the causal relationship between these variables. We find one long-run cointegrating relationship that runs from the real minimum wage to the real retail trade sales. In addition, we find that a 1% increase in the minimum wage is associated with almost a 0.5% increase in real retail trade sales in the long run. While our findings rest on several statistical assumptions, there is strong evidence in support of the position that minimum wage strengthens aggregate consumer spending, and thereby the standard of living, economic growth and stability. This is a position that differs from the conclusions drawn from mainstream academic and policy debates on the economic usefulness and efficacy of minimum wage increases.

This article addresses the gap between intern research and digital labour research. It asks: How are these interns working and living? What are the power dynamics behind interns’ experiences? To what extent can digital labour theories be applied to explore these experiences? Based on empirical research conducted at two Chinese Internet companies, this article shows that interns in Chinese Internet industries experience poor working conditions and difficult living conditions. These are caused by power dynamics within the companies, such as tensions between interns and full-time Internet workers, and power dynamics within Chinese society, such as those between Chinese universities and Internet companies involved in these internships. The article argues that such difficult conditions are caused by Internet companies and the Chinese higher education system, both of which engage in forms of coercion and alienation. Digital labour theories need to take greater account of intern labour and of interns’ experiences of precarious work in the new media industries.

In the case of the protection of labour rights in India, this article examines the extent to which the judiciary acts independently from the government of the day, and the extent to which court judgements are swayed by prevailing administrative policies. Specifically, to what extent have economic liberalisation and labour market flexibility policies influenced court decisions in cases challenging worker dismissals? Drawing on a review of 270 judgements delivered by the Supreme Court of India and the state High Courts between 1950 and 2010, a relationship is traced between a shifting pattern of Courts’ judgements and policy changes initiated by the Indian government in response to economic conditions. The objective of the study is to understand the effect of a structural shift in the economy on the cases of consented and contested decrees related to dismissal of workers under the relevant laws in India. It is found that the specific statute has not greatly changed through legal reforms, but the judiciary’s interpretations of it have changed over six decades based on dominant socio-political currents, in tune with government economic policies. This raises profound questions about judicial independence in defence of labour rights.

But, reflecting its limited mandate and limited time, it was unable to investigate the complex question of whether there are more deep-seated, fundamental issues driving financial sector misconduct, both in Australia and globally. This article argues that there are, and that consequently the benefits from the Royal Commission will be relatively short-lived, with misconduct likely to resurface, albeit in different guises.

It applies a unique set of employer–employee matched data in China and a zero-inflated negative binomial model. We find clear evidence that a longer commuting time contributes to an increase in sickness absence. The heterogeneity of the commuting–absenteeism effect can also be confirmed: longer commuting leads to higher absence rates for urban citizens but not for rural migrants. Furthermore, we explore the effect of commuting on a set of health-related outcomes. The estimations demonstrate that commuting time has a significant impact on health-related outcomes for both migrants and urban citizens, but unequal access to housing provision and to social health insurance in the Hukou system may mean that rural migrants resort to more informal medical services and thus lack access to the official sickness certificate required to seek legal sickness absence. We recommend accelerated reform of the Hukou system to encourage rural workers to seek appropriate and timely medical services, thereby reducing public health risks.

This affects migrant workers in particular, and among them those working without documentation or on various types of non-resident visas. Exploitation has become particularly embedded in a number of industries: fishing, hospitality and tourism, and in some sectors of agriculture, particularly those dependent on seasonal labour. Initially, government action to mitigate these problems was slow and reluctant but over the last decade, culminating in the reforms of 2016, there has been a more focussed effort to provide a strong legislative framework to support minimum employment standards. This article describes the background to those reforms, analyses the reforms themselves and goes on to consider whether they are adequate to ensure access to justice by disadvantaged workers.

These challenges are arguably being manifested in both an increased likelihood and magnified impact of catastrophes like forest fires, prolonged droughts, pandemics and social dislocation/upheaval. This article argues that in understanding and addressing these challenges, important lessons can be drawn from what has repeatedly caused organisational failures. It applies the ‘Ten Pathways to Disaster’ model to a series of disasters/catastrophic events and then argues this model is salient to understanding inadequate responses to the five threats to civilisation. The article argues that because these challenges interact in mutually reinforcing ways, it is critical to address them simultaneously not in isolation.

The root cause of the crisis can be traced back to the collapse of the Bretton Woods System in August 1971, and the failure to design an equitable and inclusive global financial and economic governance architecture consistent with the changed global economic realities. The vacuum was quickly taken up by the neoliberal orthodoxy that pushed the agenda of wholesale liberalisation, resulting in unprecedented domination of speculative finance capital and multinational corporation–led globalisation. This has seen falling share of wages in national income, growing wealth concentration, rising income inequality and ballooning of household debts. The consequence was frequent and increasingly deeper and wider financial crises. © The Author(s) 2018.","Debts; E32; E44; F33; G01; global economic governance; inequality; neoliberalism; O19","","Global Wealth Report 2016, (2016); Ball L., Furceri D., Leigh D., Et al., The distributional effects of fiscal consolidation, (2013); Carmona M.S., Alternatives to austerity: a human rights framework for economic recovery, Economic and Social Rights after the Global Financial Crisis, pp. 23-56, (2014); Chowdhury A., Islam I., The debate on expansionary fiscal consolidation: how robust is the evidence?, The Economic and Labour Relations Review, 23, 3, pp. 13-38, (2012); Chowdhury A., Islam I., Lee D., The great recession, jobs and social crises: policies matter, International Journal of Social Economics, 40, 3, pp. 220-245, (2013); Christophers B., Leyshon A., Mann G., Money and finance after the crisis: taking critical stock, Money and Finance after the Crisis: Critical Thinking for Uncertain Times, pp. 1-40, (2017); Global Wealth Report 2017, (2017); De Bondt W., Crisis of authority, The Global Financial Crisis and its Aftermath: Hidden Factors in the Meltdown, pp. 302-339, (2016); Annual Report 2016, (2016); Fominaya C.F., Debunking spontaneity: Spain’s 15-M/Indignados as autonomous movement, Social Movement Studies, 14, 2, pp. 142-163, (2015); Foster J.B., Revolution and counterrevolution, 1917–2017, Monthly Review, 69, 3, (2017); Foster J.B., McChesney R.W., The Endless Crisis: How Monopoly-Finance Capital Produces Stagnation and Upheaval from the USA to China, (2012); Furceri D., Loungani P., Who let the GINI out?, Finance & Development, 50, 4, pp. 25-27, (2013); Guerriero M., The labour share of income around the world: evidence from a panel dataset, (2012); Hartley J., How Federal Reserve quantitative easing expanded wealth inequality, Forbes, (2015); Harvey D., The Enigma of Capital and the Crises of Capitalism, (2010); Helleiner E., The contemporary reform of global financial governance: implications of and lessons from the past, (2009); Global debt monitor, (2018); Global debt monitor, (2018); Income inequalities in the age of financial globalization, (2008); Fiscal monitor: tackling inequality, (2017); Fiscal monitor: capitalizing on good times, (2018); Macroeconomic developments and prospects in low-income developing countries, (2018); World of Work Report 2009: The Global Jobs Crisis and beyond, (2009); James H., The End of Globalization: Lessons from the Great Depression, (2002); Jomo K.S., Jomo K.S., Introduction, Globalization under Hegemony: The Changing World Economy, pp. 1-21, (2006); Kalecki M., Kapitalizm: Dynamika Gospodarcza I Pełne Zatrudnienie (Capitalism: Economic Dynamics and Full Employment), (2015); Kanellopoulos K., Kostopoulos K., Papanikolopoulos D., Et al., Competing modes of coordination in the Greek anti-austerity campaign, 2010–2012, Social Movement Studies, 16, 1, pp. 101-118, (2017); Kolodko G.W., Globalizacja, Kryzys I Co Dalej?

A combination of political and macroeconomic factors has created a historic opportunity to turn away from the individualised, market-driven labour market policy that has prevailed since the 1980s, in favour of a more interventionist and egalitarian approach. Factors contributing to this moment include the breakdown of bipartisan consensus around key neoliberal precepts; growing public anger over inequality, insecure work and stagnant wages; and a weakening of macroeconomic conditions. Australia’s labour market is now marked by underutilisation of labour in various forms, a deterioration in job quality (especially the growth of insecure and precarious work) and unprecedented weakness in wages. The deterioration in job quality and distributional outcomes is the long-term legacy of the post-1980s shift away from Australia’s earlier tradition of equality-seeking institutional structures and regulatory practices. The current malaise in labour markets should be confronted with a comprehensive strategy to both increase the quantity of work available to Australian workers and improve its quality. The major components of such a strategy are identified, and their prospects considered, in light of the economic and political forces reshaping Australia’s labour market.

However, little attention has been paid to its consequences. A limited literature indicates that Chinese seafarers may leave state-owned enterprises to become freelance seafarers, working in the global labour market for better wages and employment conditions. There have been predictions of a substantial increase in seafarer export, with China becoming the top labour supplier to the global maritime industry. However, such expectations have been largely unmet. Through 157 qualitative interviews with seafarers and managers in Chinese ship crewing agencies, we explore some reasons why this may be so. The findings suggest that Chinese seafarers are in fact limited in their willingness and ability to leave their companies. This is due to a complex mixture of organisational, regulatory, infrastructural and personal contexts that are their everyday experience of work in China. Analysis further suggests that the underdevelopment of a national regulatory infrastructure and welfare support mechanism for seafarers, along with poor implementation of the Maritime Labour Convention 2006, combine to limit the extent of the reform of the Chinese seafaring labour market. Together, these factors help to explain why China’s seafaring labour export has been far lower than anticipated.

Through an assessment of four criteria – residency status, mobility, skill thresholds and institutional protections – we find that migrant workers arriving in Australia in the period from 1973 to 1996 had high levels of bargaining power and agency. Since 1996, migrant workers’ power and agency has been incrementally curtailed, to the extent that Australia’s labour immigration policy resembles a guest-worker regime where migrants’ rights are restricted, their capacity to bargain for decent working conditions with their employers is truncated and their agency to pursue opportunities available to citizens and permanent residents is diminished. In contrast to recent assessments that Australia’s temporary visa system is working effectively, our analysis indicates that it is failing to protect temporary migrants at work.

Typical for crowdwork is low pay, volatile income streams and no social security benefits. Also, crowdworkers have few possibilities for social comparison or negotiation because they work outside of company organisations. This article examines the question of whether these conditions mean that crowdworkers’ expectations about justice in crowdwork arrangements differ in comparison to their expectations regarding justice in conventional employment relationships. This question is addressed empirically on the basis of 36 qualitative interviews and a survey of 230 crowdworkers. The justice expectations of crowdworkers involved in different types of crowdworking platforms in German-speaking countries were examined. In our sample, crowd work typically serves to supplement – not replace – conventional employment. This explorative research shows that crowdworkers use similar standards of justice regarding work performance in their evaluations of work mediated via crowdwork platforms and conventional employment. It shows that crowdworkers perceive injustices in four specific areas: planning insecurity, lack of transparency in performance evaluation, lack of clarity in task briefings and low remuneration. These areas correspond to the theoretical dimensions of distributive and procedural justice on Colquitt’s (2001) organisational justice scale. These findings have implications for future efforts to regulate crowdwork.

This belief is shown to be incorrect, with evidence that an alternative was contemplated. Following a visit in Stockholm in January 1989 of high-ranking experts of the Consultative Economic Council (a government think-tank established shortly after martial law was introduced on 13 December 1980), the Council produced a report on the Swedish Model. The report was hoped to provide foundations for shifting the still centrally planned Polish economy towards economic efficiency and the social welfare standards of the Nordic countries. After the 1989 parliamentary elections and the appointment of the non-communist government of Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the political environment changed radically and the priority of the new government was to swiftly establish a truly liberal market economy in Poland. The article shows, however, that notwithstanding those revolutionary changes, a high-level debate took place only a few weeks after the new government came to power to discuss an option of a more gradual strategy of Poland’s economic transformation that at the same time would be of a more social democratic nature. An insider account of that debate and of its external and internal constraints is given in the subsequent sections of the article.

Even in areas of rapid per capita income growth, typified by the Gujarat model of neoliberal state-sponsored technological development, there is a substantial and increasing decent work deficit. Across India more generally, the decent work deficit is, in fact, growing along several dimensions, leading to ‘growth without development’ or ‘non-inclusive growth’. This article analyses quality of employment in India across subnational spaces – among states and between rural and urban locations – using three International Labour Organisation decent work dimensions: ‘employment opportunity’, ‘social security benefits’ and ‘social dialogue’. The analysis is based on published government data, for the period 1993–1994 to 2011–2012 – the period covered by the liberalisation experiment. The conclusion is that economic growth has not contributed significantly to employment quality. Although employment opportunity is significantly higher in the developed states, coverage of social security benefits and scope for social dialogue among regular salaried/wage workers are significantly less in these areas than in underdeveloped regions. Indeed, employment opportunity is significantly higher in rural areas, and the condition of workers in urban areas is not significantly better than in rural locations.

From the viewpoint of transaction costs theory, the less educated could benefit significantly from the digital collaborative economy due to the reduction in information costs made possible by this new form of exchange. Conversely, a positive relationship between educational level and platform use may be expected following neoclassical and institutionalist economic theories. Using microdata from the 2016 Eurobarometer survey, together with an instrumental variables strategy and conventional ordinary least squares models, hypothesis testing reveals that education has a clear positive effect on digital collaborative platform use. As a result, the less educated are less likely to access the job opportunities offered by digital labour markets. Understanding the relationship between education and access to digital collaborative platforms and impacts on socio-economic inequality is crucial for designing future public policies that promote social justice and well-being in a disrupted landscape.

This study compares two highly gendered and racially segmented labour markets, home-based family day care workers and garment homeworkers. The comparative cases examine the broader trends of migration, production and consumption that reinforce gender and racial stereotypes, and discourses that underpin representations that women workers are ideally suited to such work. We theorise the gender and racialised inequalities of homework based on the literature on invisibilisation and social reproduction to explore the vulnerable position of migrant women and the consequences of having limited options, such as legal and social protections and any capacity to collectively organise. Our analysis examines the roles and responses of institutions and conceptualises the socio-political factors that affect the characterisation of homework as non-work or as self-employed entrepreneurial activities. By mapping the differing regulatory trajectories of these two groups of homeworkers in terms of regulation and representation, we find both similarities and differences. While garment homeworkers have achieved recognition through legislation and social mobilisation, their circumstances leave them less likely to access such rights. By contrast, the failure to recognise family day care homeworkers, has left them to market forces.

A more refined approach reveals, however, that the situation of Chinese workers has not really improved: even though real wages are rising, the share of wages in the nation’s wealth has not kept pace. The reason for this is China’s position within global value chains, where the employment relationship is not solely governed by the employer–employee power relationship, but by contractual relations established between ‘lead firms’ and subcontractors. This situation echoes labour institutional economist JR Commons’ concept of ‘competitive menace’ and analyses of the structural imbalance of power in the employer/employee relationship. We argue that despite the Chinese government’s desire for industrial upgrading and its intention to develop internal labour markets, Chinese labour institutions have shown significant resistance to change making it hard to envisage any shift towards a Fordist regime of capital accumulation based on a virtuous cycle of mass production and mass consumption.

The new budgets incorporate increases in consumer prices and community standards and reflect changes in item availability, retail practices and shopping behaviour, as well as improved research methods, 20 years of use and experience, and new data. They are designed to achieve a minimum income for healthy living standard and apply to families with a breadwinner who is either in full-time work and receiving the minimum wage, or unemployed and receiving Newstart Allowance. The estimates suggest that although the minimum wage is adequate for single people, it is not adequate to meet the needs of many couple families with and without children, while Newstart Allowance does not provide an adequate safety net for the unemployed, whatever their family status. © The Author(s) 2018.","Budget standards; family needs; H55; healthy living; I18; I30; low-paid; unemployed","","Understand and maximise your superannuation, (2018); ‘Surviving, Not Living’: Submission to Senate Employment Committee on the Adequacy of ‘Allowance’ Payments, (2012); Budget Priorities Statement, 2017–18, (2017); ACTU Calls for Living Wage on 110th Anniversary of Harvester Decision (Media Release), (2017); Bradshaw J., Budget Standards for the United Kingdom, (1993); Cassells R., Dockery M., Duncan A., Falling through the Cracks: Poverty and Disadvantage in Australia.

Two major alternative measures of well-being come from subjective well-being research and the objective capability approach. The capability approach has been largely discussed in the context of development studies and economics and is mainly used within quantitative frameworks, but it also raises many questions that are worthy of discussion from a sociological perspective as well. This study opts for a qualitative approach to transpose capability approach in order to assess the well-being of female homeworkers in the football industry of Pakistan.

Focusing on cleaning work in the food and beverage industry, this case study examines some early outcomes of this national drive to reduce wage inequality by improving the pay and conditions of commodified work in a sector subject to outsourcing-based cost competition. Based on interviews with cleaners, supervisors and managers, the findings suggest that in general, government and the trade union and employers’ association have worked together, to set wages and conditions transparently. Nevertheless, enforcement issues mean that cleaners remain vulnerable. They have limited information about their employment benefits and face various types of poor conditions, some sanctioned by and others in violation of labour laws. These vulnerabilities have structural roots, including rent imbalances and cheap sourcing, factors that commodify jobs. The implementation of the Progressive Wage Model may have helped de-commodify cleaning jobs for Singaporeans and permanent residents, but such outcomes are still dependent on non-systemic and unenforceable factors such as the kindness of individual supervisors. While a promising start has been made, Singapore’s initial efforts to improve incomes and conditions in low-wage work will nevertheless require stronger regulatory commitment.

We investigate the transfer of work and employment practices from Foxconn’s manufacturing headquarters in mainland China to its subsidiaries in Czechia and the factors that influence the firm’s internationalisation of production. By drawing upon original ethnographic fieldwork, the study makes a two-fold contribution. First, it shows the analytical inadequacy of the ‘latecomer’ model which assumes that the Chinese firm is an asset seeker. Second, it illustrates the relevance of diversity of labour and non-institutionalised forms of workers’ agency for theorisation of internationalisation. These topics are still insufficiently addressed by the literature that favours managerial agency and the model of distinctive and stable national labour forces. The study contributes to the theoretical debates on internationalisation by illustrating the limits of the national institutionalist perspective, the importance of considering a multi-scalar analytical framework and the relevance of labour composition in shaping multinational employment relations.

Based on the literature on dimensions of precariousness and neoliberalism, this article will begin with an analysis of the transitioning Swedish welfare state and the contextual environment of precarious employment in Sweden. This will serve as a point of departure for the development of an occupational classification scheme including measures of income and employment security. In an empirical analysis, the occupational classification will be applied to a population-based register material including two birth cohorts of employed Swedish residents aged 28–33, with a registered income. The development of income and employment security will be described and discussed. By applying this newly developed measure of precarious employment, this article will provide a platform for future theoretical and empirical research on precarious employment in a transitioning welfare state.

From this perspective, the aim of this article is to explore whether the expansion of the welfare state should be seen as a barrier to economic growth and competitiveness, as ‘neoliberal’ economists often argue, or whether increasing public social provision might contribute to enhancing real income. After a comparative discussion of the evolution of different welfare models in developed countries, we advance our argument that public social spending is not a drain on competitiveness or an obstacle to economic efficiency. On the contrary, we explore the possibility that increasing welfare expenditure can stimulate economic growth along with lowering inequality, while the so-called ‘efficiency thesis’ (according to which globalisation needs to be accompanied by the retrenchment of welfare states in order to promote external competitiveness) produces worse economic performance and higher inequality. As a test of this hypothesis, we analyse empirical data on 34 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries from 1990 to 2013. We use econometric analysis to indicate that the so-called ‘compensation thesis’ (a process whereby globalisation is regulated through expansion of welfare states) may contribute to real income dynamics, while greater income inequality may inhibit per capita gross domestic product growth.

This article focuses on his last official role, as Chair of the World Bank Commission on Global Poverty. The report of the Commission – already referred to as the Atkinson Commission – proposes a new approach to measuring and monitoring the global poverty reduction targets established as part of the Sustainable Development Goals agreed by the United Nations in 2015. Atkinson developed the framework and provided the academic impetus to the work of the Commission and wrote much of its report, assisted by comments provided by an Advisory Board of eminent experts in the field and a smaller working group of selected members. The article describes some of the main features of the report’s 21 recommendations, focusing on the measurement of poverty in both monetary and non-monetary dimensions and its attempt to draw together national and global efforts to measure and reduce poverty in all its forms. It concludes with a discussion of the implications of the new approach for Australia, which like many other developed countries has so far failed to engage actively with the debate over addressing extreme global poverty.

This was to have particular geographical implications for the manufacturing sector in particular. Proponents of i4.0 also suggested that this process, particularly in manufacturing, would promote the re-emergence of patterns of clustering. Developments in advanced manufacturing, particularly three-dimensional printing, would accelerate and reinforce these tendencies. This article looks at the role that three-dimensional printing is supposed to play in the new world, and in particular, critically evaluates its role in reinforcing the trend towards deglobalisation on the one hand, and, on the other, new clusters of manufacturing industry.

There was a determination to create a world in which large-scale unemployment was abnormal and at worst only a temporary phenomenon. The war had shown that this was possible in a community united to pursue a common goal and the aim was to create such a community in a world free from the horrors of war, by creating communities in which the welfare of every person was important. Australia was remarkably successful in achieving this for 30 years. Its success depended on governments responding to any sustained increase in unemployment by undertaking large increases in public sector expenditure supported by accommodating monetary policy and tax cuts if desirable. In bad times as well as good, there was a determination to ensure that both the incomes and prices paid for necessities by the less well-off did not force anyone to live in poverty. The biggest obstacle to achieving this today is the growth of neoliberalism with its emphasis on ‘freedom’ or giving individuals the ability to act as they please with minimal constraints and an ideological commitment to small government.

It is committed to developing a competitive business environment, foreign investment and private sector activity in the post-communist space. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is considered to be a key inter-state mechanism enabling member states to negotiate post-communist reforms. The paper reorients analysis of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, claiming that existing framings of the role of the EBRD ignore its tangible neoliberalising pressures. It argues that the EBRD works to fundamentally restructure states in the post-communist space in three ways: (1) the configuration of an ‘appropriately’ neoliberal economic space, (2) the construction of subaltern subjectivities in the regional space, and (3) the persistent dominance of expert knowledge and policy practice external to the state. This restructuring is intended to further neoliberalism in the economic space of the region. By uncoupling the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development from a state centric analysis, the paper reveals how the technical aspects of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development activities configure particular neoliberal rationalities and competencies not as a putative superstate, but as a key site for the ever-deeper encroachment of neoliberalisation in peripheral European states.

It is claimed that labour laws arrest employment creation by making the labour adjustment process difficult. Additionally, it is claimed that workers’ increased bargaining power raises the effective cost of labour, hindering employment creation. This article critically examines both these claims. First, it questions whether labour laws can be held responsible as an explanation for employment stagnation in the organised sector as a whole, since a close reading of the Indian legislation reveals that labour laws apply in less than 35% of aggregate employment in the organised sector in India. Next, it investigates whether employment stagnation in those industry segments where labour laws apply – namely, organised manufacturing – is due to restrictions on ‘hiring and firing’. We find no evidence to support this hypothesis. Finally, it analyses the trend in workers’ bargaining power through various indicators, and finds such power to be unambiguously declining. Thus, the study finds no empirical support for the two conventional arguments put forward to explain employment stagnation in the organised sector of the Indian labour market.

How did the restoration of capitalism in the former Eastern bloc affect the economic and political situation in the world? Is the support of workers and lower classes for right-wing populists that has been observed in Eastern Europe for the past 30 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall a permanent phenomenon? By asking these questions, the authors point out that the offensive of the far right began in Europe before the 2015 migration crisis and the 2008 financial crisis, and that it coincided with the weakening of leftist workers’ parties. This process began in the 1990s after the collapse of the Eastern bloc. What can stop this process and change the situation? The solution is to show that another model is still possible: greater egalitarianism, democracy and the rule of law. This sociopolitical alternative, however, must simultaneously oppose two powerful forces: neoliberal capitalism and nationalist populism.

Based on the testimony of seafarers and regulatory agencies, it demonstrates that the Maritime Labour Convention provisions lack the necessary elements for an effective regulatory steer. This is because the conditions shown to support this form of representation are absent from or underdeveloped in the shipboard work environment. The article concludes with some suggested ways to enhance the Convention’s provisions to achieve a more positive effect for seafarers.

Creating value and mitigating harm are typically explicit in the objects of public policy and implicit in adjudication, administration and adherence under public policies. Although conceptually distinct, creating value and mitigating harm can be both complementary and detrimental to each other. This article reviews various combinations of legislative objects over more than a century of Australian labour and employment relations policy. The objects examined include the prevention of industrial disputes, the introduction of a social minimum wage, the expansion of enterprise bargaining, expansion or curtailment of tribunal powers by government and other developments. Questions of ‘for whom?’ value is created or harm is mitigated are key. As an inductive study, the article concludes with hypotheses to guide future research, including implications that reach beyond Australia and employment legislation.

We argue that, predictably, policy-makers and employers took the home for granted as a background support of economic life. Acting as if home is a cost-less resource that is free for appropriation in an emergency, ignoring how home functions as a site of gendered relations of care and labour, and assuming home is a largely harmonious site, all shaped the invisibility of the imposition. Taking employee flexibility for granted and presenting work-from-home as a privilege offered by generous employers assumed rapid adaptation. As Australia emerges from lockdown, ‘building back better’ to meet future shocks entails better supporting adaptive capabilities of workers in the care economy, and of homes that have likewise played an unacknowledged role as buffer and shelter for the economy. Investing in infrastructure capable of providing a more equitable basis for future resilience is urgent to reap the benefits that work-from-home offers. This article points to the need for rethinking public investment and infrastructure priorities for economic recovery and reconstruction in the light of a gender perspective on COVID-19 ‘lockdown’ experience.

Neoliberal housing policy and the financialisation of housing has resulted in a housing affordability crisis. Historically, Australian housing policy has afforded only a limited role to local government. This article analyses the results of a nation-wide survey of Australian local governments’ perceptions of housing affordability in their local government area, the possibilities for their meaningful intervention, the challenges they face, the role of councillors and councils’ perceptions of what levels of government should take responsibility for housing. Almost all of the respondents from Sydney and Melbourne councils were clear that there is a housing affordability crisis in their local government area. We apply a framework analysing housing policy in the context of neoliberalism and the related financialisation of housing in order to analyse the housing affordability crisis in Sydney and Melbourne. We conclude that in order to begin resolving the housing crisis in Australia’s two largest cities there has to be an increasing role for local government, a substantial increase in the building of social and affordable housing and a rollback of policies that encourage residential property speculation.

The pandemic’s disastrous worldwide health impacts have been exacerbated by, and have compounded, the unsustainability of economic globalisation based on the neoliberal dismantling of state capabilities in favour of markets. Flow-on economic impacts have simultaneously created major supply and demand disruptions, and highlighted the growing within-country inequalities and precarity generated by neoliberal regimes of labour market regulation. Taking an Australian and international perspective, we examine these economic and labour market impacts, paying particular attention to differential impacts on First Nations people, developing countries, women, immigrants and young people. Evaluating policy responses in a political climate of national and international leadership very different from those in which major twentieth century crises were addressed, we argue the need for a national and international conversation to develop a new pathway out of crisis.

This article explores the possibility of a distinctive Australasian contribution to our understanding of wellbeing economics in public policy. The introduction section presents an analytical wellbeing framework showing how human actions draw on services provided by the country’s capital stocks to create and sustain personal and communal wellbeing. The second section chronicles some landmark policy initiatives in Australia and New Zealand for understanding and monitoring wellbeing, culminating in the Wellbeing Budget. The third section highlights four areas for further development: (1) the role of family wellbeing in intergenerational wellbeing, (2) the role of cultural capital in providing foundations for future wellbeing, (3) the role of Indigenous worldviews in enriching understandings of wellbeing and (4) the role of market enterprise in expanding capabilities for wellbeing. These are all areas where Australasian researchers have demonstrated expertise.

Employing a unique firm-level data set from a large US truckload motor carrier, we identified two different driver groups hired during two distinct pay regimes. Before-and-after data on wages and safety outcomes created a natural experiment. Higher wages paid to experienced drivers in the new pay regime led to higher driver retention rates. Experienced drivers had lower average crash costs and were more productive during each tenure month. Experienced drivers had a much larger expected discounted net present value when compared with inexperienced drivers. As the previously inexperienced drivers gained additional experience, their crash probabilities and their value began to mirror those of the experienced drivers, demonstrating the value of greater tenure. This research supports ‘safe rates’ public policy because safety pays – for trucking companies, for cargo owners and for society.

While international experience of marketised social care has demonstrated the vulnerability of social care workers to wage theft and other violations of employment laws, Australia’s relatively strong industrial relations safety net might be expected to be better able to protect these low-paid workers. Nevertheless, there is emerging evidence of negative impacts on the pay and entitlements of frontline workers in the expanding community support and homecare workforce. This study investigates the paid and unpaid work time of disability support workers under Australia’s new National Disability Insurance Scheme. The research takes a novel approach combining analysis of working day diaries and qualitative interviews with employees to expose how jobs are being fragmented and work is being organised into periods of paid and unpaid time, leaving employees paid below their minimum entitlement. The article highlights the role of social care policy along with inadequate employment regulation.

A key issue is the role of deterrence measures that penalise violations. Employment standards enforcement in Ontario, like in most jurisdictions, is based mainly on a compliance framework promoting voluntary resolution of complaints and, if that fails, ordering restitution. Deterrence measures that penalise violations are rarely invoked. However, the Ontario government has recently increased the role of proactive inspections and tickets, a low-level deterrence measure which imposes fines of CAD295 plus victim surcharges. In examining the effectiveness of the use of tickets in inspections, we begin by looking at this development in the broader context of employment standards enforcement and its historical trajectory. Then, using administrative data from the Ministry of Labour, we examine when and why tickets are issued in the course of workplace inspections. After demonstrating that even when ticketable violations are detected, tickets are issued only rarely, we explore factors associated with an increased likelihood of an inspector issuing a ticket. Finally, we consider how the overall deterrent effect of workplace inspections is influenced by the use or non-use of deterrence tools.

This was the culmination of a century of struggle to establish the ‘right to work’, once a key objective of the 19th century labour movement. Deeply resented and long resisted by employer groups, the policy was abandoned in the mid-1970s, without an electoral mandate. Although the Australian Labour Party and union movement urged public vigilance to preserve full employment during 23 years of Liberal rule, after 1978 they quietly dropped the policy as the Australian Labour Party turned increasingly to corporate donors for the money they needed to stay electorally competitive. While few leading lights of today’s Labour movement care to discuss it, it is right that Australians celebrate this bold statement of our right to work, and the 30 years of full employment it heralded.

Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 20 permanently and 17 precariously employed seafarers. In contrast with those on permanent contracts, seafarers employed by crewing agencies on temporary contracts were deployed at short notice and commenced work on vessels irrespective of whether they had experienced an adequate rest period at home. Such precariously employed seafarers were also deployed across the various sectors of the industry on unfamiliar vessels. Seafarers felt strongly that scheduling and location uncertainties were closely linked with increased risks to their safety and well-being, and it was clear that these areas of uncertainty were frequently experienced in combination, in particular, by those with precarious employment arrangements. The article, therefore, suggests that the widespread disorganisation of the employment relationship increases the occupational health and safety risks faced by those working in an already dangerous industry. It concludes that this lack of commitment by shipping companies to their workforce means that, for many seafarers, protection against these additional risks is effectively at the discretion of the captain on board.

In this context, this article considers why there has been recent growth in reported cases of underpayment of wages, particularly of temporary migrant workers, and why the state has failed to implement a strategy to adequately address this problem. The article examines the fragmented nature of employment regulation and visa categories constraining worker agency which, combined with widening avenues for temporary migration, have contributed to the underpayment problem. We also consider how conflicting imperatives of the state, business influence over the policy process and weak political incentives to address underpayment help to account for the state’s inaction.

Research indicates that youth employment has been negatively impacted by these changes. For young people seeking to enter the labour market, particularly those combining employment and study, precarious employment has become the norm. However, precarious employment is, for many, no longer a stepping stone on the path to permanent employment. Many young Australians, even those with higher education qualifications, experience prolonged periods of precarious employment. To examine how new employment landscapes are experienced by young workers, we conduct analysis of data collected by the Life Pattern Project, a longitudinal mixed-methods study. Our results show that precarious employment is related to lower levels of job satisfaction and autonomy in young adulthood.

We estimate the labour supply curve for long-haul truck drivers in the United States, applying two-stage least squares regression to a national survey of truck drivers. We start with the standard model of the labour supply curve and then develop two novel extensions of it, incorporating pay level and pay method, and testing the target earnings hypothesis. We distinguish between long-haul and short-haul jobs driving commercial motor vehicles. Truck and bus drivers choose between long-distance jobs requiring very long hours of work away from home and short-distance jobs generally requiring fewer hours. The labour supply curve exhibits a classic backward bending shape, reflecting drivers’ preference to work until they reach target earnings. Above target earnings, at a ‘safe rate’ for truck drivers, they trade labour for leisure, working fewer hours, leading to greater highway safety. Drivers work fewer hours at a higher pay rate and likely have less fatigue. Pay rates also have implications for driver health because worker health deteriorates as working time exceeds 40 hours. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Compensation; labour markets; labour supply curve;

However, a relatively neglected aspect of this history was a campaign to secure worker inspectors (check-inspectors). These began in coalmining a century before similar measures were introduced for workers more generally as part of overhauling occupational health and safety laws in the 1970s/1980s. We document this struggle for mine safety in Australia and New Zealand, and the activities of check-inspectors in the period to 1925. Notwithstanding strong opposition from coal-owners and conservative governments, check-inspectors played an important role in safeguarding coalminers and improving the regulatory oversight of coalmines. Check-inspectors not only gave coalminers a ‘voice’ in OHS, but they also provided an exemplar of the value and legitimacy of worker’s ‘knowledge activism’. This system remains. Furthermore, the struggle is relevant to understanding contemporary debates about collective worker involvement in occupational health and safety.

Despite governments’ efforts to improve labour standards and encourage employer-centred voluntary compliance programmes, infringements of workers’ rights are widely reported. Using a qualitative socio-legal study of Chinese seafarers’ workers’ compensation rights, we investigate whether shipping companies and their crewing agencies comply with their legal obligations following workplace injuries and fatalities. Through 74 semi-structured interviews and analysis of crew management policies from 7 shipping companies, we identify a failure of most shipowners’ internal policies to comply with legal obligations. Furthermore, multinational shipping companies use crewing agencies to evade their liabilities to injured seafarers. We propose the establishment of a joint liability mechanism between employers and labour intermediaries to fill this compliance gap that exists in global human resource supply chains.

The key to a sociological understanding of capitalist modernisation is the combination of two perspectives present in social sciences: analysis in terms of shock therapy and the prospect of debt. Referring to the concepts of the ‘rent theory of ownership’, the role of foreign debt, creditor–debtor relations and the resulting crisis are submitted to analysis as the key factors of modernisation. Finally, the social, political and cultural consequences of the neoliberal transformation are also considered. These are argued to be growing right-wing populist and authoritarian tendencies.

This article aims to mark the occasion by drawing attention to some of his key works in economics and to present some of his ideas in a way that will make sense to readers not familiar with or very much interested in the complexities of the labour theory of value. I begin with a brief biography and a summary of his main works in economics. I then explore in some detail ideas related to the economic surplus, unpaid labour and exploitation, and attempt to tease out the implications of his analysis for the determination of the wage share. While I argue that Marx has not succeeded in providing adequate theoretical support for his prediction that the wage share will fall as capital accumulates, he has nonetheless provided a very interesting and insightful collection of ideas by which we may, even today, approach a wide range of issues relating to production and distribution.

Here we explore policy options for an Australian Basic Income. Our analysis responds to concerns that Basic Income is both too expensive and too radical a departure from existing welfare state structures to be a feasible policy option. Drawing on policy and Basic Income scholarship we identify changes to Australia’s current means-tested benefits structures that move substantially towards Basic Income while remaining consistent with historic policy norms, which we call ‘affluence testing’. Using microsimulation we explore fiscal and distributional trade-offs associated with the implementation of an affluence-tested Basic Income. Our results suggest Basic Income has the potential to significantly reduce inequality and poverty while also requiring taxes to rise substantially. Placing these trade-offs in international context we find the policy would reduce inequality to levels similar to Nordic welfare states while increasing overall taxation to approximately the OECD average.

We use data from the National Central Statistical Office, our own preliminary research, social surveys and the Watch Health Care database. Domestic data are analysed and compared with trends in Western Europe as described in Eurostat and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development reports. The decreasing number of active physicians remaining in the health care system results in long waits for specialist appointments. The demand for doctors from Central and Eastern Europe will continue to grow. Consequently, there will be a further outflow of medical staff from Poland and other countries in the region and the current problems with access to health care will continue.

However, the implications of precarity for workers’ education have not been adequately explored. There is a great need for an approach to workers’ education that will advance the social and economic interests of precarious workers and other marginalised communities who are becoming a major segment of the workforce. Based on in-depth interviews, this article identifies education regarding wages, women and work, working conditions, labour laws and practical skills like public speaking, reading and writing as core elements of a curriculum for the education of precarious workers. Given that precarious workers tend not to be organised in formal structures, non-governmental organisations and trade unions will have to reach out to them to make sure that they provide alternative structures able to craft educational programmes that can build the confidence of precarious workers so that they can challenge their precariousness.

Despite some successes, including at reducing poverty, the South African economy has been characterised by low growth, rising unemployment and increasing inequality, which together with rampant corruption and governance failures combine to threaten the very core of the country’s stability and democracy. The neo-liberal economic policies that the African National Congress–led government surprisingly adopted in 1996 in order to assuage global markets sceptical of its historical support for dirigiste economic policy, have simply not worked. Appropriate progressive macroeconomic interventions are urgently needed to head off the looming prospect of a failed state in the country which Nelson Mandela led to democracy after his release from prison in February 1990. What happens in Africa’s southern tip should still matter for progressives all around the world. The article draws on both history and theory to demonstrate the roots of such progressive heterodox economic thinking and support for a more carefully coordinated activist state-led macroeconomic policy, both in general terms and in the South African context. It shows that such approaches to growth and development – far from being populist – also have a rich history and respectable theoretical pedigree behind them and are worthy of inclusion in the South African policy debate.

However, non-driving work is not necessarily paid. This article analyses how the payment for non-driving duties (non-driving pay) affects truck drivers’ work hours. Using the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Long-Haul Truck Driver survey, the study finds that remunerating drivers for non-driving duties decreases drivers’ work hours. Drivers who are paid for their non-driving labor may reach their target earnings in fewer work hours, leading them to refrain from working extremely long hours and more willingly comply with working time regulations. The policy implication is that paying for non-driving labor can prevent drivers from working excessively long hours, mitigating fatigue, and consequent accidents. Thus, pay for non-driving labor may enhance their safety and health.

In many disciplines concerned with aspects of industrial relations, including political science, law and history, it is the traditional political ideologies of the industrial era which take centre stage: liberalism (classical, social and neoliberalism), socialism (Marxism, social democracy and labourism) and conservatism. By contrast, ideological issues in the discipline of employment relations are chiefly addressed in terms of Fox’s three analytical perspectives: unitarism, pluralism and radicalism. The disjunction between these parallel discourses goes largely unnoted in the literature of the relevant disciplines, which all tend to proceed using their own preferred approach without making reference to the other. This article critically explores the relationship between these two discourses and investigates the broader implications that the existence of the two different discursive traditions has for the analysis of industrial relations phenomena in Australia. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Ideology;

China is now the world’s largest user of industrial robots. A Lewis turning point has been predicted, involving a transition from a plentiful supply of rural low-cost workers to a labour shortage economy in which rising labour costs drive labour-technology substitution. The routine-biased technological change hypothesis suggests that technology-induced routinisation in job task content has a profound impact on employment structure. This study captures the extent of routinisation of jobs in the transitional context of China and examines the incidence and impact of routinisation on labour turnover in the labour market. Using rotating panel data from the China Labour-force Dynamics Survey 2012, 2014 and 2016, this study, based on individual information with regard to flexibility in work schedules and degree of autonomy in workload and task content on the job, follows a recently developed measure to construct a routine intensity index and indicates a division into three routine intensity groups. The empirical findings show that the probability of job mobility is significantly increased with the magnitude of routine task intensity, suggesting that the process of technology-induced routinisation is strongly associated with labour turnover.

The results of our statistical models suggest that overall, franchisees are indeed more likely to violate ES, have a higher probability of monetary/wage-related violations, and are less likely to repay such violations. However, the results vary substantially by industry. While franchisees had only marginally higher probabilities of an ES violation in two of the seven industry-groups examined, five of the seven industries showed substantially higher probabilities of a monetary violation. The results also show that franchisees in three industry groups (retail, accommodation and food services, and education, public administration, healthcare and social services) are particularly prone to monetary violations.

Brexit has been portrayed as a British backlash against globalisation and a desire for a reassertion of sovereignty by the UK as a nation-state. In this context, a vote to leave the European Union has been regarded by its protagonists as a vote to ‘take back control’ to ‘make our own laws’ and ‘let in [only] who we want’. We take a particular interest in the stance of key ‘Brexiteers’ in the UK towards regulation, with the example of the labour market. The article commences by assessing the notion of Brexit as a means to secure further market liberalisation. This analysis is then followed by an account of migration as a key issue, the withdrawal process and likely future trajectory of Brexit. We argue that in contrast to the expectations of those who voted Leave in 2016, the UK as a mid-sized open economy will be a rule-taker and will either remain in the European regulatory orbit, or otherwise drift into the American one.

In Europe, in particular, the need for internal devaluation within European Union nations in financial difficulty precipitated a wave of labour market reforms alongside the reform of welfare systems struggling to cope with high levels of unemployment. Various analyses have explored the nature of these changes separately for the labour market and welfare systems. Using a conceptual framework rooted in a political economy understanding the social nature of labour, this article takes an inclusive approach to understanding regulatory changes for both employed and unemployed labour. We do this using the case of Ireland, a country that went through a severe economic crisis, was subject to a European Union/European Central Bank/International Monetary Fund bailout in 2010 and witnessed one of the most significant labour market crises in Europe. The Irish case is instructive because it highlights both the range and depth of regulatory interventions utilised by the state during periods of crisis to deal with the social nature of labour and its role under advanced capitalism.

China’s 2008 Employment Contract Law, legislated amid policy debate, was intended to remedy these phenomena. We examine a crucial element of its remit: has its promotion of continuing contracts as against fixed-term employment contracts been effective? This is crucial for improving workers’ rights through secure employment. How have employers responded to this challenge to their prerogatives in terms of hiring and firing? We analysed data from 2007 and 2012 drawn from All-China Federation of Trade Unions surveys, which cover approximately 80,000 individuals. Using institutional theory, we discuss a variety of employer responses. We find that the Employment Contract Law has increased the likelihood of signing continuing contracts among migrant workers, employees in privately owned enterprises, and those with lower professional titles and who are short-term employees – all disadvantaged labour market categories previously. It has also significantly narrowed gaps regarding access to continuing contracts between these categories and matched advantaged ones. There is also evidence that some employers seek to avoid or sidestep compliance through cost-minimising worker engagement strategies.

Based on purposive sampling, the qualitative findings, drawn from interviews with precarious workers aged 18–29 years in Hong Kong, reveal tensions among four types of aspirations. First, the desire for achieving freedom and individual ambition in work made the respondents critical of the notion of employment-related stability. Second, a determination to break with mainstream career paths empowered young people to take alternative pathways to new modes of work and life. Third, precarious employment was seen as a stepping stone for realising plans for travel or study. Finally, tolerance of precarity was perceived as a transitional stage in their striving for future stability. However, the findings also show the structured dilemmas experienced by young workers regarding the complex relationship between autonomy and precarity in a neoliberal labour market. Some young workers pursued work–life autonomy, constrained by precarious employment relations, acknowledging and bearing the costs, while some strategically used precarity in individual negotiations with employers to realise their goals. This article analyses young workers’ subjectivity through the lenses of autonomy and age and pushes the boundary of precarity studies beyond an implicit dichotomy between determinism and voluntarism.

The argument is based on a historical materialist approach focusing on the social relations of production as a starting point. It is contended that the uneven and combined unfolding of ‘post-communist’ transformation has subjected Baltic labour to doubly constituted exploitation processes. First, workers in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have suffered from extreme neoliberal restructuring of economic and employment relations at home. Second, migrant workers from Central and Eastern Europe in general, trying to escape exploitation at home, have faced another set of exploitative dynamics in host countries in Western Europe such as the UK.

In 31 Chinese provinces between 2004 and 2015, the employment effect of a minimum wage depended on the minimum wage level, foreign direct investment, per capita gross domestic product and labour productivity. A minimum wage increase reduced hiring as foreign direct investment inflow rose, regardless of the amount of investment. Any positive employment effect of a minimum wage increase was mitigated by per capita gross domestic product growth, except when per capita gross domestic product was above the average. Above-average labour productivity enhancement significantly mitigated the adverse employment effect of the minimum wage. Employers responded to a rising minimum wage by increasing hiring when the geometric growth rates of the minimum wage and foreign direct investment for a particular province within a period of time were above the overall average across provinces. However, they scrutinised both annual and overall economic growth within a time period when making hiring decisions in the face of minimum wage adjustments. An inverted U-shape relationship between minimum wages and employment suggest a maximum threshold value for the minimum wage. Thus, government policy measures should foster short-term and long-term economic growth, to facilitate employment creation when minimum wages increase.

Yet, despite its increasing economic and social relevance in Europe, there is little research on Economy for the Common Good firms and the quality of the jobs they offer their employees. We thus, first, introduce the ideas of this movement and then present findings on workplace characteristics and the well-being of workers. Our results are based on our own survey of Economy for the Common Good employees from 2018 and on the sixth wave of the European Working Conditions Survey. Our analyses offer mixed support for the claims of the Economy for the Common Good – while Economy for the Common Good workers can be found in high-quality work settings, their absenteeism and presenteeism, as well as indicators of control, time pressure, direct participation and financial participation do not differ from other workers when controlled in a propensity score matching approach. Based on our findings and feedback from Economy for the Common Good representatives, we conclude that the introduction of Economy for the Common Good ideas might be too recent to see any positive effects, but also that Economy for the Common Good companies should place more focus on their employees’ well-being.

To address this possibility, I test a broader measure of multiple jobholding to examine its prevalence in the Canadian workforce based on two national studies of workers (2011 Canadian Work Stress and Health Study and 2019 Canadian Quality of Work and Economic Life Study). Almost 20% of workers in 2019 reported multiple jobholding – a rate that is three times higher than Statistics Canada estimates. While multivariate analyses reveal that the multiple jobholding rate in 2019 was 30% higher than in the 2011 Canadian Work Stress and Health Study, multiple jobholders in 2019 were less likely to report longer work hours in secondary employment. Analyses also revealed that having financial difficulties is consistently associated with multiple jobholding in 2011 and 2019. Collectively, these findings suggest that while the spread of short-term work arrangements has facilitated Canadians’ secondary employment decisions, for many workers these decisions may reflect underlying problems in the quality of primary employment in Canada, rather than labour market opportunity. I discuss the potential links between multiple jobholding, the gig economy and employment precariousness.

Less attention has been paid to the efficacy of state regulation in establishing a climate of prevention as well as redress. We examine the role of the Dutch Working Conditions Act as a means of mitigating workplace bullying from the perspective of legislative intention, processes and outcomes. Semi-structured interviews with stakeholders involved in creating, influencing and implementing the Act are analysed thematically to highlight how contextual, employer and phenomenon-specific factors affect the effectiveness of legislation with regard to workplace bullying. The findings indicate that state involvement, organisational commitment and collective action are all important contributors in reducing workplace bullying, but that even in the context of neoliberalism, the role of the nation-state is of critical importance, notwithstanding initiatives by employers.

There are more than 50 current ISO standards on nanotechnology. Some of these relate to the working environment and occupational risk management. In Latin America, entities that are members of ISO are enunciating national versions of the international standards. In this article, this context is analysed critically, starting from the Mexican standard on occupational risk management in the working environment. Even though risk management standards may guarantee better and safer working conditions, in the field of nanotechnology, they simultaneously unlock detrimental implications for workers and society. Reliance on such private and voluntary forms of industry self-regulation is identified as a by-product of global neoliberalism. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Corporate self-regulation; environmental risk management; ISO; labour standards; Mexico; nanoparticles; nanotechnology; neoliberalism; occupational health; voluntary standards; workplace safety","","Appelbaum R., Zayago Lau E., Foladori G., Et al., Inventory of nanotechnology companies in Mexico, Journal of Nanoparticle Research, 18, 2, pp. 1-13, (2016); Bagattolli C., Invernizzi N., Difusión de la nanotecnología en Brasil.

Few safety studies associate crashes with economic pressure, a pervasive latent influence. This study uses data from the US Large Truck Crash Causation Study to predict truck crashes based on work pressure factors that have their origins in market pressures on motor carriers and truck drivers. Logistic regression shows that factors associated with the work process, including an index of work-pressure attributes, predict the likelihood that crash analysts consider the truck driver to be the person whose last action could have prevented the crash.

However, such broad skill categories involve numerous essential competencies that can be differentially rewarded or go simply unrewarded. Using US data, this article analyses the demand for and payment of linguistic competency, a cross-cutting kind of skill that is basic for both cognitive and social work in the new economy and is one of the human capacities that is most difficult to automate. While human capital theory predicts an increase in wages as the demand for linguistic skills rises, from cultural/institutional perspectives, it can be theorised that communicative abilities and foreign-language knowledge are socially undervalued because of their association with feminised activities, ethnicity, and low-status service jobs. We analyse the demand and reward for linguistic skills through a two-step analysis of occupational and individual data derived from two sources: the Occupational Information Network and the Current Population Survey. Results show that while ‘hard’ verbal-reasoning skills are associated with high average salaries, as is predicted by neoclassical theory, the potentially undervalued linguistic skills – interactive and multilingual skills – are unrewarded and even penalised. This evidence requires further political attention, given its implications for large number of workers, especially in feminised, low-status service jobs.

In this new context of labour relations, experiences and expectations of each other are key drivers for the primary parties to this social dialogue. There has been little systematic research investigating the conditions for constructive social dialogue, particularly when it comes to ‘soft factors’, such as perceived competences, trust, influence and conflict behaviours. Addressing these issues based on theories of conflict, trust and influence, this article investigates experiences and expectations of employee representatives on the part of human resource managers, their counterparts in social dialogue. The results of surveys conducted in 11 European countries indicate that, overall, employers found a model of structured dialogue with elected employee representatives useful. Furthermore, competences of employee representatives, cooperative conflict behaviours, informal relations and trust promoted the influence of employee representatives on organisational decision-making and the quality of these decisions. We discuss implications for different systems of industrial relations.

This phenomenon is characterised as an instance of the ‘Dutch disease’ – the negative impact of windfall revenue inflows on the competitiveness of other tradable sectors and hence on overall economic growth. While the real effect of workers’ remittances on real exchange rates in a recipient economy is still a controversial issue, several studies have analysed evidence for the existence of the ‘Dutch disease’ phenomenon in various sets of countries. The main objective of this study is to examine whether remittance flows have had any adverse effect on the international trade competitiveness of a selected group of developing countries during the period from 1995 to 2014. Using a one-step system Generalised Method of Moments specification within a simultaneous equation approach, it shows that remittance flows depreciate the real exchange rate at their levels and that the lagged value of remittances create the Dutch disease for this country group. In addition, we confirm that while trade openness and world real interest rates contribute to a depreciation in real exchange rates, gross domestic product per capita and net Official Development Aid inflows tend to appreciate real exchange rates. A policy implication is that trade liberalisation policies that lower tariff rates on capital imports and new export-oriented incentive programmes should be accompanied by measures designed to prevent appreciation in the real exchange rate: steps in this direction such as recent macroeconomic and prudential capital flow management initiatives are briefly referenced.

In the case of Bolivia, the labour force is becoming more heterogeneous over time, which could imply positive effects induced by a closer match between labour supply and recruiters’ needs. However, we show that this is not the case. We revisit the transition mechanisms from college to the workplace, positing recruiters’ interpretations of educational credentials as a crucial determining factor for employability in the formal sector. In a two-branch correspondence study, 2848 fictitious CVs were sent to 1424 formal firms in the three main urban Bolivian areas. We find a large university reputation premium. Applicants from well-valued universities are around 40% more likely to receive a positive response – a 2.25 percentage point advantage from a 7.87% baseline likelihood. Thus, the increasingly heterogeneous labour force is generating additional informational frictions in the labour market, rather than promoting a more efficient matching process.

Insecurity of tenure results in a significant wage penalty for short-term workers, compared with those with longer term contracts. This article estimates the negative effect of short-term contracts on the wages of Indian regular wage workers all along the income distribution – unlike earlier studies – using the method of unconditional quantile regressions on data from the 68th round and the 61st round of the National Sample Survey Organisation on Employment covering the period 2004–2005 and 2011–2012. It finds that the wage penalty due to short-term contracts is higher for high-wage workers than for low-wage workers, with the maximum impact felt by median wage workers, and has increased for higher paid workers from 2004–2005 to 2011–2012. The spread of informal employment arrangements within India’s formal labour markets has resulted in an increasingly unequal distribution of workers’ access to the benefits of growth, reflecting a shift in power in favour of capital. These findings, specific to a developing economy like India, stand in contrast with studies in European countries, where high-wage workers do not face as much of a penalty for short-term contract work as low-wage workers.

Although an abundant literature addresses the relationship between openness and economic growth, the real effect of trade liberalisation is still ambiguous and undetermined. Most previous studies have ignored the selection effects of strict labour regulations on international trade. The main objective of this study is to measure the role of labour regulations in moderating the contribution of trade to economic growth among 30 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries for the period 2006–2013. In doing so, we employ a one-step Generalised Method of Moments system estimation method. Our results reveal that openness to trade does not have a robust and significant effect on growth. However, the interaction of openness with strict labour regulations enhances the contributions of trade to growth. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Dynamic panel data; growth; international trade; labour standards; openness","","Arellano M., Bond S., Some tests of specification for panel data: Monte Carlo evidence and an application to employment equations, The Review of Economic Studies, 58, 2, pp. 277-297, (1991); Bahmani-Oskooee M., Niroomand F., Openness and economic growth: an empirical investigation, Applied Economics Letters, 6, 9, pp. 557-561, (1999); Busse M., Hefeker C., Trade, labour market regulations and growth, Applied Economics Letters, 16, 8, pp. 809-812, (2009); Cameron A.C., Trivedi P.K., Microeconometrics Using Stata, (2010); Dollar D., Outward-oriented developing economies really do grow more rapidly: evidence from 95 LDCs, 1976-1985, Economic Development and Cultural Change, 40, 3, pp. 523-544, (1992); Frankel J.A., Romer D., Does trade cause growth?, The American Economic Review, 89, 3, pp. 379-399, (1999); Harrison A., Openness and growth: a time-series, cross-country analysis for developing countries, Journal of Development Economics, 48, 2, pp. 419-447, (1996); Huang L.C., Chang S.H., Revisit the nexus of trade openness and GDP growth: does the financial system matter?, Journal of International Trade & Economic Development, 23, 7, pp. 1038-1058, (2014); Hye Q.M.A., Lau W.Y., Trade openness and economic growth: empirical evidence from India, Journal of Business Economics and Management, 16, 1, pp. 188-205, (2015); Jin J.C., Openness and growth: an interpretation of empirical evidence from East Asian countries, Journal of International Trade & Economic Development, 9, 1, pp. 5-17, (2000); Kim D.H., Lin S.C., Suen Y.B., Are financial development and trade openness complements or substitutes?, Southern Economic Journal, 76, 3, pp. 827-845, (2010); Levine R., Renelt D., A sensitivity analysis of cross-country growth regressions, The American Economic Review, 82, 4, pp. 942-963, (1992); Lutz J., Growth of industrialized countries and trade openness, The International Trade Journal, 15, 4, pp. 429-455, (2010); Protecting jobs, enhancing flexibility: a new look at employment protection legislation, OECD Employment Outlook, (2013); Romer P.M., Endogenous technological change, Journal of Political Economy, 98, 5, pp. 71-102, (1990); Roodman, Mixed-process models with cmp, IDEAS Working Paper Series from RePEc, (2009); Sachs J.D., Warner A., Economic reform and the process of global integration, Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, 26, 1, pp. 1-118, (1995); Solow R.M., Technical change and the aggregate production function, The Review of Economics and Statistics, 39, 3, pp. 312-320, (1957); Staiger D., Stock J.H., Instrumental variables regression with weak instruments, Econometrica, 65, 3, pp. 557-586, (1997); Vamvakidis A., Regional trade agreements or broad liberalization: which path leads to faster growth?, IMF Staff Papers, 46, 1, pp. 42-68, (1999)","A.R.

However, it is less clear why, historically, loose credit arrangements were so widespread. Somewhat misleadingly, much conjecture has laid blame at the feet of financial institutions themselves. While it is true that duplicitous and even corrupt lending practices were consequential antecedents of the crisis, a legacy commitment to certain – laudable – elements of New-Dealism created context for these elements to become established. To understand really what went wrong, it is necessary to look back before the 2000s and appreciate the interaction that was occurring between a long-term policy commitment to neoliberalism and piecemeal/fragmented application of approaches that aimed to assist financially disadvantaged people. Using the analogy of heart-attack pathology to guide some of its analysis, this essay argues for better policy-integration.

Shapiro was an American Post-Keynesian economist, who was a bridge figure in radical economics, connecting Marx to Keynes, Schumpeter to Kaldor, the behavior of the firm to the dynamics of the macroeconomy, and the process of innovation to the organization of production and accumulation. She was seminal to important moments in the history of radical economics in the US, including the formation of the Hegel-inspired journal Social Concept in the 1980s and the Rutgers University’s Post-Keynesian circle in the 1980s and 1990s. Shapiro’s deeply philosophical and dialectical approach to firm behavior, innovation, and business cycles led her to theorize the “revolutionary character” of Post-Keynesian economics and to formulate a critique of the competitive neoclassical firm which, she argued, is at odds with the logic of capitalism in which firms seek to make profit and grow.

The approach is to a significant extent reminiscent of that adopted following the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC). The article examines the effectiveness of active labour market policy in Sweden over the period 2007–2012. By analysing these earlier policy outcomes, the aim is to assess the success of active labour market policy more broadly. The hypothesis that greater labour market flexibility allows the labour market policy to be more efficient is evaluated. With a focus on the labour supply, possible reasons for the reduced efficiency of state interventions are outlined using regression models. Conclusions derived from the models point to the failure of earlier Swedish active labour market policy towards the vulnerable groups of the unemployed, unemployed women and men aged 15–19 years and the long-term unemployed.

This article scrutinises one of the most recently described types of non-standard work, which is known as quasi-formal or under-declared employment. Companies relying on this illegitimate strategy, which is particularly prevalent in Europe, deliberately misreport the take-home pay of their formally employed workers. Alongside the officially declared wage, a quasi-formal worker thus receives an additional cash-in-hand payment which remains untaxed. To explore why so many European Union workers accept quasi-formal jobs in spite of obvious limitations, we report the evidence from interviews with 616 workers who were surveyed within the Special Eurobarometer 284/Wave 67.3. A two-level cumulative logistic regression emphasises tax morale and the exact function of the cash-in-hand payment as the key factors in this respect. On the other hand, neither perceived detection risk nor expected penalties are found to affect the readiness of quasi-formal workers to keep obeying an illegitimate arrangement with their employer. These findings therefore endorse recent studies on the matter, which illuminate low trust in the state and fellow citizens as the main reason for many workers to voluntarily misreport their income.

As part of the trend towards self-regulation, the International Maritime Organisation has adopted a worldwide International Safety Management Code which made ship managers responsible for workplace health and safety. This study, based on interviews in two Chinese shipping companies, examines how ship managers use ship visits to monitor shipboard safety management. Interviews with managers from company offices and crew members indicated that managerial ship visits mainly take the form of inspections that focus on low-trust surveillance and disciplinary action rather than genuine support, being based on the safe person rather than the more effective safe place approach. From the perspective of crew members, because the managers visited ships only occasionally, they were unlikely to have sound knowledge of the specific situations and work routines on their ships. Consequently, managers’ interventions for safety compliance were seen by crew members as failing to address real risk factors, and leading instead to increased workloads, psychological pressure and fatigue, the very antithesis of safety management. Meanwhile a coherent, supportive system for reducing risk remains underdeveloped in the shipping industry.

Neoliberalisation and globalisation generate and utilise the mobility of both capital and labour. Meanwhile, labour migration is presenting a challenge to the observance of labour rights. Present-day methods of capital accumulation rely on the search for cheap labour and the relocation of production to territories that do not protect workers’ rights. Effective defence of labour rights must take place at the transnational level, where most capital is generated. Trade unions need to cross national borders in order to move social activity into this area. The defence of workers’ rights must go hand in hand with the struggle against nationalism and racist prejudices. In this context, migrant workers become one of the main potential driving forces of the modern global proletariat.

Applying Karl Polanyi’s double-movement concept, it is concluded that these two, in essence neoliberal, transformations have led to societies being deeply divided economically, socially and culturally. Moreover, the self-protection of transformation losers is generating adverse political outcomes on a global scale. For both reasons, the outcomes of neoliberal transformations are jeopardising also the viability of the European Union, which was initially built on the basis of a regulated capitalism. The future of the global economy and also of the European Union depends on how the conflicts between the deepening of unregulated globalisation, national sovereignty and democratic politics can be solved.

This article reviews and discusses the alternative views on the causes of the slowdown in accumulation and growth and the policies implemented and proposed to deal with it. It is argued that growing inequality, notably the secular decline in the share of wages, and financialisation are the main factors. Neither spending booms driven by financial bubbles, nor exporting unemployment through trade provides sustainable solutions. It is necessary to rebalance capital and labour, restrain finance and assign a greater role to the public sector in aggregate demand management and income and wealth distribution. However, the dominant neoliberal ideology rules out such socially progressive and economically effective solutions. Consequently, stagnation is likely to remain the new normal in the years to come with governments attempting to reignite growth by creating credit and asset bubbles and/or trying to export unemployment through beggar-thy-neighbour macroeconomic, labour market, trade and exchange rate policies, thereby generating financial and economic instability and tensions in international economic relations with significant repercussions for emerging and developing economies. © The Author(s) 2018.","Financial bubbles; stagnation; underconsumption; wage shares","","Akyuz Y., The Financial Crisis and the Global South: A Development Perspective, (2012); Atoyan R., Manning J., Rahman J., Rebalancing: evidence from current account adjustment in Europe.

It proposes a conception of work as a potential source of eudaimonic well-being, providing meaning and contributing to human flourishing and self-realisation. Based on micro-level data, the article shows the relevance of distinguishing between hedonic and eudaimonic well-being by way of comparing the effects of increased financial difficulties and deteriorated work conditions on these two types of well-being in five European Union countries – Germany, Poland, Portugal, Sweden and the UK – in the post global financial crisis years between 2009 and 2014. The article concludes by underlining the political importance of addressing aspects pertaining to the quality of working life and of creating jobs that serve to improve the eudaimonic well-being of citizens.

It provides a qualitative analysis of work–family conflict, establishing that not only work but also family life has become more precarious. The contours of precariousness of both work and family are analysed through interviews with 50 female nurses working full time in different areas of health service provision. The findings suggest that the neoliberal restructuring of health services has led to staffing deficits along with workload intensification, unpredictable work schedules and poor organisational support. This has increased work–family conflict, defined as a form of precariousness because it heightens the difficulties, risks and insecurities entailed in balancing family-related expectations with increasing work demands for female nurses. This precariousness makes spousal support critical if nurses are to be able to address work–family conflict and leads to nurses’ compliance with unfavourable working conditions as a way to resolve the mutual interference of family and work. The increased subordination of life to work has resulted from the neoliberal managerialisation of health services, creating precarisation in the lives of female nurses.

The global medical crisis arising from the worldwide spread of COVID-19 is predicted to lead to a global economic crisis and subsequent deep depression. The resultant economic, social and political repercussions are likely to be felt for years or even decades to come, equalling the great depression of the last century. Consequently, it is difficult to make long-term accurate predictions about the impact of new technologies on industry, society, and labour. In this context, the aim of this introductory article to the themed volume is to consider the potential challenges and opportunities associated with the Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies and potential impacts on work and workplaces. This introductory article comprises an international collection of research that examines the impact of technological change on employment and working conditions with consideration given to the additional impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.

As a rapidly emerging source of labour and settlers for Australia's immigration programme, temporary skilled migration will have a major and potentially long-lasting impact on Australia. Since the mid-1990s, temporary skilled migration (under the subclass 457 visa programme) has overtaken permanent migration to Australia. India is now the largest and fastest growing source of temporary skilled migrants. This is a major new development in Australian migration history; yet, to date, there has been little qualitative research into the subjective experiences, motivations and settlement patterns of Indian temporary skilled migrants in Australia, from the perspective of the migrant. This article presents findings from a 3-year qualitative study on the experiences of temporary skilled migrants from India living and working in Australia. It argues that many of the quantitative studies on this topic fail to offer a nuanced reading of these workers' experiences in Australia, in particular, their situations of vulnerability engendered by the recruitment process, visa conditions, unlawful employment practices and living arrangements. © The Author(s) 2013.","India; J15; J61; migration; precarious work; vulnerable workers","","People in Australia who were born in India, Census - All People - Usual Residents. 2011 Quickstats Country of Birth, (2013); Temporary Skilled Migration: A New Form of Indentured Servitude, (2006); Biao X., Gender, dowry and the migration system of Indian information technology professionals, Indian Journal of Gender Studies, 12, pp. 357-378, (2005); Biao X., Global 'Body Shopping': An Indian International Labor System in the Information Technology Industry, (2007); Caspersz D., Violence and colonial dialogue: The Australian-Pacific indentured labour trade, Labor History, 49, pp. 389-391, (2008); Castles S., The guest-worker in Western Europe: An obituary, International Migration Review, 20, 4, pp. 761-778, (1986); Castles S., How nation-states respond to immigration and ethnic diversity, Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies, 21, 3, pp. 293-308, (1995); Castles S., Kosack G., Immigrant Workers and Class Structure in Western Europe, (1973); Cohen R., Migration and Its Enemies: Global Capital, Migrant Labour and the Nation-State, (2006); Connell J., Burgess J., Migrant workers, migrant work, public policy and human management, International Journal of Manpower, 30, 5, pp. 412-421, (2009); Deegan B., Visa Subclass 457 Integrity Review, (2008); India Country Profile, (2012); Subclass 457 State - Territory Summary Report 1 July 2012 to 28 February 2013, (2013); Hugo G., A New Paradigm of International Migration: Implications for Migration Policy and Planning in Australia, (2004); Temporary Business Visas.

Findings show that the pay structure varies across employment sectors - waged and self-employed - and that the determinants of employment sector vary by gender and family roles. Differences in human capital investment and geopolitical zones also need to be considered. The estimates in the study reveal that there is a marriage premium for both males and females in the waged labour market, but partially support Becker's (1991) gender-based household specialisation model in terms of the relative incidence of self-employment. There is a wage penalty for married women with children in the paid-employment labour market, but motherhood is also negatively associated with income levels for self-employed women. We also find a fatherhood penalty for paid-employed men. Nevertheless, overall, the gender difference is higher in relatively less regulated self-employment compared to the more regulated paid employment labour market. Findings therefore offer some policy inputs but also suggest the need for further research into the causes of the gender pay gap in self- and paid employment, and thus into the overall wage gap in Nigeria that inhibits women's labour market participation and welfare. © University of New South Wales.","Family; gender; marriage; Nigeria; paid employment; self-employment; wage differential","","Aderemi T.A., Does the wage curve exist in Nigeria?

Departing from a review of this literature, we take a step further from the 'flexicurity' prescription, to follow the capabilities approach of Sen and others, and develop a concept of social capabilities - based flexicurity for a learning economy, arguing that labour market performance must be targeted in an approach that includes a strong commitment to social well-being. © University of New South Wales.","Capabilities; flexibility; flexicurity; institutions; labour market; unemployment","","Baccaro L., Rei D., Institutional determinants of unemployment in OECD countries: Does the deregulatory view hold water?, International Organization, 61, 3, pp. 527-569, (2007); Baker D., Glyn A., Howell D.R., Howell D.R., Et al., Labour market institutions and unemployment: A critical assessment of the cross-country evidence, Fighting Unemployment: The Limits of Free Market Orthodoxy, pp. 72-113, (2005); Berg J., Kucera D., In Defense of Labour Market Institutions, (2008); Blanchard O., Wolfers J., The role of shocks and institutions in the rise of European unemployment: The aggregate evidence, The Economic Journal, 110, 462, pp. 1-33, (2000); Burroni L., Keune M., Flexicurity: A conceptual critique, European Journal of Industrial Relations, 17, 1, pp. 75-91, (2011); Crocker D.A., Functioning and capability: The foundations of Sen's and Nussbaum's development ethic, Political Theory, 20, 4, pp. 584-612, (1992); Daveri F., Tabellini G., Unemployment, growth and taxation in industrial countries, Economic Policy, 15, 30, pp. 47-104, (2000); Elmeskov J., Martin J.P., Scarpetta S., Key lessons for labour market reforms: Evidence from OECD countries' experiences, Swedish Economic Policy Review, 5, 2, pp. 205-252, (1998); Frame M., Khan H.A., Deep Democracy: A Political and Social Economy Approach, (2007); Freeman R.B., Labour market institutions without blinders: The debate over flexibility and labour market performance, International Economic Journal, 19, 2, pp. 129-145, (2005); Freeman R.B., Labour Market Institutions Around the World, (2008); Freeman R.B., Failing the test?

Australia is host to a large and growing population of immigrants working without authorisation, described as the most significant problem facing Australian immigration authorities. These undocumented workers are often exploited by employers through wage theft, sexual harassment and unsafe working conditions. Yet, they are not entitled to protection under Australias employment laws. In addition to the implications for workers, there are broader policy concerns arising from the current system of regulation that effectively rewards employers who are equally in breach of immigration law. Left uncorrected, current regulation may in fact be encouraging a race to the bottom for employment standards and increasing undocumented immigrant work. As well as highlighting the inadequacy of the existing regulatory framework, potential avenues for addressing this are explored. © The Author(s) 2015.","Employment conditions; industrial/employment relations policy; informal economy; low-paid workers; migrant workers","","Counts of Australian Businesses, (2014); Australian Labour Market Statistics, (2014); Bernhardt A., Milkman R., Theodore N., Broken Laws, Unprotected Workers: Violations of Labor Laws in Americas Cities, (2009); Capps R., Fortune K., Fix M., Trends in the Low-Wage Immigrant Labor Force, 2000-2005, (2007); Carens J., The rights of irregular migrants, Ethics and International Affairs, 22, 2, pp. 163-186, (2008); Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), (2012); Costello C., Bogg C., Costello C., Davies A., Migrants and forced labour: A labour law response, The Autonomy of Labour Law, (2015); Cunningham-Parmeter K., Fear of discovery: Immigrant workers and the Fifth Amendment, Cornell International Law Journal, 41, 1, pp. 27-82, (2008); Australias Migration Trends 2012-2013, (2014); Fact Sheet 87 ' Initiatives to Combat Illegal Work in Australia, (2013); Dewhurst E., Models of protection of the right of irregular immigrants to back pay: The impact of the interconnection between immigration law and labor law, Comparative Labor Law and Policy Journal, 35, 2, pp. 217-246, (2014); Café Operators Penalised $110,000 for Paying International Students Just $8 An Hour, (2015); Court Action after Alleged Underpayment of Overseas Worker at 7-Eleven in Brisbane, (2015); Darwin Café to Face Court for Allegedly Underpaying Overseas Workers, (2015); Sushi Bar Reimburses Korean Backpacker, Revamps Workplace Practices after $5000 Underpayment, (2015); Garnaut J., Five million visas into Australia this year likely to set records, Sydney Morning Herald, (2015); Guthrie R., Tourists overstaying their welcome: When the visa runs out and the workers stay on, The Tourism Industry, 6, pp. 1-16, (2004); Guthrie R., Quinlan M., The occupational safety and health rights and workers compensation entitlements of illegal immigrants: An emerging challenge, Policy and Practice in Health and Safety, 3, 2, pp. 69-89, (2005); Howells S., Report of the 2010: Review of the Migration Amendment (Employer Sanctions) Act 2007, (2011); Labour Inspection Convention, (1947); James N., Fair Work Ombudsman Annual Report 2013-2014, (2014); Magalhaes L., Carrasco C., Gastaldo D., Undocumented immigrants in Canada: A scope literature review on health, access to services, and working conditions, Journal of Immigrant Minority Health, 12, 5, pp. 132-151, (2010); Orr G., Arup C., Gahan P., Howe J., Unauthorised workers: Labouring beneath the law?, Labour Law and Labour Market Regulation, pp. 677-695, (2006); Peck J., Theodore N., Politicizing contingent work: Countering neoliberal labor market regulation from the bottom up?, South Atlantic Quarterly, 111, 4, pp. 741-776, (2012); Why Undocumented or Irregular?, (2015); Issues Paper 1, January.

Descriptive analysis shows that low-skill clerical workers are the most affected and that Scandinavian countries fare better.

In Australia, problems with schedule and budget overruns have been addressed through business process reforms aimed at tightening control and improving professionalism. However, studies of complex contracting in other contexts show the importance of relational factors of trust, collaboration and risk-sharing. These factors are not encouraged by the predominantly transactionally based contractual environment of Defence. Based on a detailed examination of three case studies, we suggest that there is a disjunct between the types of controls that are applied by Defence and the requirements of delivering complex, long-term projects involving multiple stakeholders. The need for both improved flexibility as well as heightened accountability is evident. We argue that balancing these values involves processes that encourage, rather than discourage, communication, risk-sharing and trust. © The Author(s) 2013.","Australia; contracts; contractualism; defence; flexibility; H570; H830; procurement; public-private partnerships; trust","","Aulich C., O'Flynn J., From public to private: The Australian experience of privatisation, The Asia Pacific Journal of Public Administration, 29, 2, pp. 153-171, (2007); Status Reporting of Major Defence Projects, (2001); Management of the M113 Armoured Personnel Carrier Upgrade Project, (2006); 2007-08 Major Projects Report Defence Materiel Organisation, (2008); Management of the FFG Capability Upgrade, (2008); The Super Seasprite, (2009); Management of the Collins-class Operations Sustainment, (2009); 2008-2009 Major Projects Report Defence Materiel Organisation, (2009); Management of the M113 Armoured Personnel Carrier Upgrade Project, (2009); Light-weight Torpedo Replacement Project, (2010); Upgrade of the M113 Fleet of Armoured Vehicles, (2012); 2011-2012 Major Projects Report Defence Materiel Organisation, (2012); Procurement Procedures for Defence Capital Projects Preliminary Report, (2011); Procurement Procedures for Defence Capital Projects Final Report, (2012); Bittleston M., Co-operation or competition?

The analysis supports arguments that the model of the developmental state, based on planned public/private cooperation, provides an alternative policy prescription to that of sole reliance on the self-regulating market. The Federal Land Development Agency is shown not only to have survived but also to have thrived as an economic development arm of the Malaysian state, successfully adapting to the changing environment in which it operates. To delineate the changes, a framework of punctuated equilibrium is utilised as it best captures the instances of rapid discontinuous change and the periods of incremental change and relative stability. © University of New South Wales.","Developmental state; economic development; FELDA; land settlement; Malaysia; punctuated equilibrium; state-owned enterprises","","Historical Koperasi Permodalan FELDA (KPF) Dividend Rate; Abdullah F., Affirmative action policy in Malaysia: To restructure society, to eradicate poverty, Ethnic Studies Report, 15, 2, pp. 189-221, (1997); Andriopoulos C., Dawson P., Managing Change, Creativity and Innovation, (2009); The Saemaul Undong Movement in the Republic of Korea: Sharing Knowledge on Community-Driven Development, (2012); Aziz U.A., Poverty and rural development in Malaysia, Kajian Ekonomi Malaysia, 1, 1, pp. 70-105, (1964); Bahrin T., FELDA 21 Years of Land Development, (1977); Bahrin T., Lee B., FELDA: 3 Decades of Evolution, (1988); Bolman T., Deal T., Reframing Organizations: Artistry, Choice and Leadership, (2008); Chee S., Inayatullah C., Government policy and rural development in Malaysia, Approaches to Rural Development in Asia: The Southeast Asian Experience, pp. 35-61, (1975); Creswell J., Research Design: Quantitative and Qualitative Approaches, (1994); Dessein W., Santos T., Adaptive organizations, Journal of Political Economy, 114, 5, pp. 956-995, (2006); Drabble J., An Economic History of Malaysia, c1800-1990: The Transition to Modern Economic Growth, (2000); Dunphy D., Griffiths A., Benn S., Organizational Change for Corporate Responsibility: A Guide for Leaders and Change Agents of the Future, (2007); Second Malaysia Plan, 1971-1975, (2017); Annual Report 2014, (2014); (2017); About FGV, (2017); Sustainability News Updates and Reports, (2017); Sustainability Overview, (2017); Fold N., Oiling the palms: Restructuring of settlement schemes in Malaysia and the new international trade regulations, World Development, 28, 3, pp. 473-486, (2000); Fong C., Integrated population-development program performance: The Malaysian FELDA experience, Journal of Developing Areas, 19, 1, pp. 149-170, (1985); Social Progress Through Land Development: Lessons from Malaysia's FELDA, (2012); Gosling L., Barlow R., The demographic implications of agricultural land settlements: A case study of Malaysia's FELDA, Case Studies in the Demographic Impact of Asian Development Projects, pp. 59-100, (1982); Gould S., Ever since Darwin: Reflections in Natural History, (1978); Graetz F., Rimmer M., Smith A., Et al., Managing Organizational Change, (2011); Guba E., Lincoln Y., Fourth Generation Evaluation, (1989); Guyot D., The politics of land: Comparative development in two states of Malaysia, Pacific Affairs, 44, 3, pp. 368-389, (1971); Hafidz Mahpar M., FGV's Q3 Loss May Be Partly Due to Fraud at Overseas Operations, (2016); Hayes J., The Theory and Practice of Change Management, (2007); Hirschman C., Yeoh S.-P., Ethnic patterns of urbanization in Peninsular Malaysia, 1947-1970, Southeast Asia Journal of Social Science, 7, pp. 1-19, (1979); Isa A., Changes in FELDA, The Star Online Business News, (2017); Jomo K., A Question of Class: Capital, the State, and Uneven Development in Malaya, (1986); Kamaruddin S.B., Aging Settlers Poses Challenge to FELDA, (2013); Khor Y., Saravanamuttu J., Augustin D., High Carbon Stock+.

This article examines the strategies adopted by unions to counteract this trend. It uses Weil's 'strategic choice framework' to assess the attempts of the Trades Union Congress to encourage affiliates to adopt innovative ways of reaching precarious workers and examines the extent to which these strategies have been implemented. Unfavourable external shifts have placed greater pressure on unions to develop appropriate internal strategies and structures to strengthen their capacity for reaching precarious workers. The Trades Union Congress has encouraged unions to use community unionism strategies to organise precarious workers outside of the workplace and sustainable sourcing strategies to regulate their conditions through procurement mechanisms. These strategies are relatively effective means of reaching precarious workers in the context of legal constraints on unions and changes in the organisation of work and production. The internal governance structures of the British union movement need to be reformed if these strategies are to be adopted more widely. © The Author(s) 2013.","Britain; community unionism; inequality; J51; J53; labour standards; organising; precarious work; sustainable sourcing; trade unions; vulnerable work","","Broughton A., UK: Flexible Forms of Work: 'Very Atypical' Contractual Arrangements, (2010); Brown W., Edwards P., Brown W., Bryson A., Forth J., The Evolution of the Modern Workplace, pp. 255-274, (2009); Hard Work, Hidden Lives: The Full Report of the Commission on Vulnerable Employment, (2008); Daniels G., Trade Unions in A Neoliberal World: British Trade Unions under New Labour, pp. 63-97, (2009); Darlington R., The state of workplace union reps' organization in Britain today, Capital & Class, 34, 1, pp. 126-135, (2010); Trade Union Membership 2012: Statistical Bulletin, (2013); Ewing K.D., The function of trade unions, Industrial Law Journal, 34, 1, pp. 1-22, (2005); Fine J., Community unions and the revival of the American labor movement, Politics & Society, 33, 1, pp. 153-199, (2005); Fitzgerald I., O'Brien P., Like taking coals to Newcastle: A new era of trade unionism in the North East of England?, Capital & Class, 29, 3, pp. 17-27, (2005); Gautie J., Schmitt J., Low-Wage Work in the Wealthy World, (2010); Goos M., Manning A., Lousy and lovely jobs: The rising polarization of work in Britain, Review of Economics and Statistics, 89, 1, pp. 118-133, (2007); Grimshaw D., Marchington M., Rubery J., Fragmenting Work: Blurring Organizational Boundaries and Disordering Hierarchies, pp. 1-38, (2005); Gumbrell-Mccormick R., European trade unions and 'atypical' workers, Industrial Relations Journal, 42, 3, pp. 293-310, (2011); Heery E., Trade unions and contingent labour: Scale and method, Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy and Society, 2, 3, pp. 429-442, (2009); Heyes J., Recruiting and organising migrant workers through education and training: A comparison of community and the GMB, Industrial Relations Journal, 40, 4, pp. 182-197, (2009); Holgate J., Organizing migrant workers: A case study of working conditions and unionization in a London sandwich factory, Work, Employment and Society, 19, 3, pp. 463-480, (2005); Holgate J., The Complexity of Community Unionism: A Comparative Analysis of Concepts and Contexts, pp. 49-74, (2009); James P., Johnstone R., Quinlan M., Regulating supply chains to improve health and safety, Industrial Law Journal, 36, 2, pp. 163-187, (2007); Lloyd C., Mason G., Mayhew K., Low-Wage Work in the United Kingdom, (2008); Marchington M., Rubery J., Cooke F.L., Fragmenting Work: Blurring Organizational Boundaries and Disordering Hierarchies, pp. 239-260, (2005); Martinez Lucio M., Perrett R., Meanings and dilemmas in community unionism: Trade union community initiatives and black and minority ethnic groups in the UK, Work, Employment and Society, 23, 4, pp. 693-710, (2009); Martinez Lucio M., Stuart M., Union Revitalisation in Advanced Economies: Assessing the Contribution of Union Organising, pp. 17-37, (2009); Mason G., Mayhew K., Osborne M., Low-Wage Work in the United Kingdom, pp. 15-40, (2008); Mason G., Mayhew K., Osborne M., Low-Wage Work in the United Kingdom, pp. 41-95, (2008); Moore S., Watson M., UNISON Migrant Workers Participation Project: Evaluation Report, (2009); Munro A., Rainbird H., Opening doors as well as banging on tables: An assessment of UNISON/employer partnerships on learning in the UK public sector, Industrial Relations Journal, 35, 5, pp. 419-433, (2004); Nowak P., Union Revitalisation in Advanced Economies: Assessing the Contribution of Union Organising, pp. 131-153, (2009); O'Grady F., Nowak P., Union Organization and Activity, pp. 150-163, (2004); Pennycook M., Whittaker M., Low Pay Britain 2012, (2012); Simms M., Trade union strategies to recruit new groups of workers - United Kingdom, European Industrial Relations Observatory Online, (2010); Smith P., New labour and the commonsense of neoliberalism: Trade unionism, collective bargaining and workers rights, Industrial Relations Journal, 40, 4, pp. 337-355, (2009); Stirling J., There's a new world somewhere: The rediscovery of trade unionism, Capital & Class, 29, 3, pp. 43-63, (2005); Stuart M., Cook H., Cutter J., Evaluation of the Union Learning Fund and Unionlearn: Preliminary Findings, (2010); Tattersall A., Power in Coalition: Strategies for Strong Unions and Social Change, (2010); Taylor R., The TUC: From the General Strike to New Unionism, (2000); Wallis E., Stuart M., Greenwood I., Learners of the workplace unite!'

The study undertakes an empirical assessment of the main sources of youth unemployment in Africa. Based on panel data of 41 African countries covering the period 2000-2010, the study finds a demographic youth bulge and poor economic growth from both supply and demand sides of the market to be key drivers of youth unemployment in Africa. Employment-to-population ratio as a measure of country's job creation ability and vulnerable employment as a proxy for informality are observed to have had a decreasing effect on youth unemployment. The empirical findings also suggest higher youth employment rates among females than males and a higher concentration in urban than rural areas. Investment in the high labour absorption sectors of agriculture and manufacturing is advocated as job creation strategies, along with population control measures to slow the growing youth population in Africa. High growth in the low employment sectors of mining and extractive industries could serve as resource generating avenues to promote investment in education and skill training, along with infrastructure to facilitate growth in high labour absorption sectors. © University of New South Wales.","Africa; economic growth; informal economy; labour markets; theories of unemployment; vulnerable workers; youth unemployment","","Promoting Youth Employment, (2012); African Youth Charter, (2006); Akerlof G.A., The market for lemons, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 84, 3, pp. 488-500, (1970); Akerlof G.A., Labour contracts as partial gift exchange, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 97, 4, pp. 543-569, (1982); Anyanwu J., Characteristics and macroeconomic determinants of youth employment in Africa, African Development Review, 25, 2, pp. 107-129, (2013); Aryeetey E., Baah-Boateng W., Ackah C., Et al., Ghana country study, Youth and Employment in Sub-Saharan Africa: Working but Poor, pp. 232-302, (2014); Baah-Boateng W., Determinants of unemployment in Ghana, African Development Review, 25, 4, pp. 385-399, (2013); Baah-Boateng W., Youth employment challenges in Africa: Policy options and agenda for future research, Plenary of the AERC Biannual Conference, Lusaka, Zambia, (2014); Baah-Boateng W., Unemployment in Africa: How appropriate is the global definition and measurement for policy purpose, International Journal of Manpower, 36, 5, pp. 650-667, (2015); Baah-Boateng W., Adjei P., Oduro A.D., Determinants of moonlighting in Ghana: An empirical investigation, African Review of Economics and Finance, 4, 2, pp. 176-202, (2013); Becker G.S., Human Capital: A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis, (1975); Bell N.F., Blanchflower D.G., Young people and the great recession, Oxford Review of Economic Policy, 27, 2, pp. 241-267, (2011); Bentolila S., Juan J.D., Jimeno J.F., Reforming An Insider-outsider Labour Market: The Spanish Experience, (2011); Blackaby D., Leslie D., Murphy P., Et al., Unemployment among Britain's ethnic minorities, The Manchester School, 67, 1, pp. 1-20, (1999); Choudhry M.T., Marelli E., Signorelli M., Youth unemployment rate and impact of financial crises, International Journal of Manpower, 33, 1, pp. 76-95, (2012); Cling J.-P., Gubert F., Nordman J., Et al., Youth and Labour Markets in Africa: A Critical Review of Literature, (2007); Collier P., Hoeffler A., Rohner D., Beyond greed and grievance: Feasibility and civil war, Oxford Economic Papers, 61, 1, pp. 1-27, (2009); Curtain R., Youth and employment: A public policy perspective, Development Bulletin, 55, pp. 7-11, (2001); Dickens W.T., Lang K., An analysis of the nature of unemployment in Sri Lanka, Journal of Development Studies, 31, 4, pp. 620-636, (1995); Fares J.M., Claudio E., Peter F.O., How are youth faring in the labour market?

To be eligible for public housing, new entrants usually have to be in 'greatest need'. This study argues that the shift in the eligibility criteria for accessing public housing means that public housing estates increasingly reflect what Loïc Wacquant calls 'advanced urban marginality'. The article assesses whether the features of advanced urban marginality that are identified by Wacquant capture and can be usefully used to analyse the shifts and contemporary characteristics of public housing. The article draws on existing data and in-depth interviews with 33 older (aged more than 65 years) public housing tenants in Sydney, Australia, to analyse the residualisation of public housing using the features of advanced marginality identified by Wacquant - 'wage labour as a vector of social instability and life insecurity', 'functional disconnection from macroeconomic trends', 'territorial fixation and stigmatisation', 'spatial alienation and the dissolution of place', 'loss of hinterland' and 'social fragmentation and symbolic splintering'. The study concludes that although Wacquant's analysis is useful and captures much of what has occurred in public housing estates in Sydney, in many instances, public housing remains a source of pride for its tenants and provides them with the basis for a good life. © The Author(s) 2013.","Advanced urban marginality; anti-social behaviour; greatest need; I14; I38; J14; older tenants; public housing; residualisation","","Arthurson K., Operationalising social mix: Spatial scale, lifestyle and stigma as mediating points in resident interaction, Urban Policy and Research, 28, 1, pp. 49-63, (2010); Arthurson K., Jacobs K., Housing and Anti-Social Behaviour, pp. 259-279, (2006); Atkinson R., Jacobs K., Public Housing in Australia: Stigma, Home and Opportunity, (2008); Atkinson R., Habidis D., Easthope H., Sustaining Tenants with Demanding Behaviour: A Review of the Research Evidence, (2007); Regulation and Growth of the Not-for-profit Housing Sector, (2010); Commonwealth State Housing Agreement National Data Reports, 2004-05, Public Housing, (2005); Who Receives Priority Housing and How Long Do They Stay, (2008); A Profile of Social Housing in Australia, Cat.

A government safety inspector usually investigates each incident. The investigation may lead to prosecution of the employer or another party deemed to have breached relevant legislation. However, little systematic research has examined the needs and interests of grieving families in this process. Drawing on interviews with 48 representatives of institutions that deal with deaths at work (including regulators, unions, employers, police and coronial officers), this article examines how they view the problems and experiences of families. Notwithstanding some recent improvements, findings indicate ongoing shortcomings in meeting the needs of families regarding information provision, involvement and securing justice.","Industrial relations; Safety prosecutions; Traumatic workplace death; Workplace health and safety","","Almond P., Public perceptions of work-related fatality cases: Reaching the outer limits of 'populist punitiveness'?, British Journal of Criminology, 48, 4, pp. 448-467, (2008); Biddle L., Public hazards or private tragedies?

'Place' is used in a political context by examining how global realities are experienced in place, and the author argues the need to look at the everyday realities of the crisis from a gendered ontological perspective in order to counter grand narratives of gloom and doom where women (whether old, young, migrant, heterosexual or otherwise) are particular victims. By discussing local contexts of the gendered realities of the crisis in three southern Europe areas, the author shows the possibility of changing the crisis narrative from one of overwhelming paralysis to one of potential transformation. The focus is on the rise of resistance, solidarity economies and new types of communities in the search by women in southern Europe for alternatives to neoliberal capitalism. © The Author(s) 2014.","Austerity; European economic crisis; gender; social justice","","Bettio F., Corsi M., D'Ippoliti C., The Impact of the Economic Crisis on the Situation of Women and Men and on Gender Equality Policies, (2012); Ergani Centre News, (2014); Escobar A., Encountering Development: The Making and Unmaking of the Third World, (1994); Escobar A., Beyond the Third World: Imperial Globality, Global Coloniality, and Anti-globalization Social Movements, (2003); The Price of Austerity - The Impact on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in Europe (Web Edition), (2012); Fraser N., Feminism, capitalism and the cunning of history, New Left Review, 56, pp. 97-117, (2009); Fraser N., A Triple Movement?

This article focuses on job-sharing, which is a unique yet underexplored form of part-time work and one which has rarely been analysed in terms of the consequences for all stakeholders. This case study of job-sharing details its positive outcomes for some employees, in assisting them to balance career and family. The study also highlights some previously unexplored and, we argue, unintended negative consequences of job-sharing. In this case, job-sharing contributed to the increased use of temporary employees who were locked out of many of the benefits of quality flexible work. Furthermore, the case study reveals competing interests between permanent and temporary employees, creating a range of challenges for human resource practitioners in managing and developing both groups. © © The Author(s) 2015.","Employment conditions; flexibility; gender; non-standard employment; working hours","","Flexible Working and Work-life Balance, (2007); (2013); Best Practice Guide - Work and Family: The Right to Request Flexible Working Arrangements, (2013); Flexible Work Arrangements, (2015); Baird M., OBrien M., Dynamics of parental leave in Anglophone countries: The paradox of state expansion in liberal welfare regimes, Community, Work and Family, 18, 2, pp. 198-217, (2015); Boyd C., Job-sharing: Are two heads better than one?, Intheblack, 78, 5, pp. 38-41, (2008); Branine M., Part-time work and job-sharing in health care: Is the NHS a family-friendly employer?, Journal of Health Organization and Management, 17, 1, pp. 53-68, (2003); Brocklebank J., Whitehouse H., Job-sharing in academic libraries at the senior management level: Experiences of job-sharing at deputy and director level, Library Management, 24, 45, pp. 243-251, (2003); Burgess J., Exploring job quality and part-time work in Australia, Labour and Industry, 15, 3, pp. 29-40, (2005); Charlesworth S., Part-time and part-committed?: The challenges of part-time work in policing, Journal of Industrial Relations, 49, 1, pp. 31-48, (2007); Charlesworth S., Chalmers J., Studies in quality part-time employment, Labour and Industry, 15, 3, pp. 1-6, (2005); Working Part-time, (2013); Cooper R., Baird M., Bringing the right to request flexible working arrangements to life: From policies to practices, Employee Relations, 37, 5, pp. 568-581; Dick P., Bending over backwards?

These funds, created to stimulate a recovery in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and to stabilise financial markets, ended up mostly as emerging markets' corporate bonds and loans (often after being leveraged into many multiples of their original value). Not for the first time, emerging markets became the financial markets of last resort. These funds were then either mainly invested (Asia) or used (as in Latin America and South Africa) for almost anything except for creating additional productive capacities. Enquiries into these issues, especially how corporations financed their investment, were subjects that fascinated economist Ajit Singh. He was the first to find out that corporations in emerging markets relied much more on external finance than those in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (where retained profits played a major role). The implication was that they were likely to be more susceptible to the vicissitudes of financial markets, and these have become even more weird since quantitative easing, as Northern 'investors', in search for elusive yields, have been happy to take on ever higher risks, leverage and illiquidity in the South. This is a key difference between current global financial fragilities and those at the onset of the current global financial crisis in 2007. The stakes for emerging economies and international financial markets could scarcely be higher, but unfortunately these huge new challenges occur at the worst possible time, as our social imagination has seldom been so barren. © University of New South Wales.","Asia; corporate debt; corporate finance; corporate investment; emerging markets; excess liquidity; financial liberalisation; financialisation; Keynes; Kindleberger; Latin America","","Global Wealth Report, (2015); Anderson S., Klinger S., A Tale of Two Retirements, (2015); Avdjiev S., Chui M., Song Shin H., Non-financial corporations from emerging market economies and capital flows, BIS Quarterly Review, (2014); Statistics Database, (2015); Buffet W., About Warren Buffet: Quotes, The Warren Buffet Way, 500; Evolución de la PTF en Chile, (2013); La Inversión y El Ahorro en América Latina: Nuevos Rasgos Estilizados, Requerimientos para El Crecimiento y Elementos de Una Estrategia para Fortalecer Su Financiamiento, (2013); Fisher R.W., Remarks before the Economic Club of Minnesota, 7 October, (2010); Total Economy Database, (2015); Gruber J.W., Kamin S.B., The Corporate Saving Glut in the Aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis, (2015); Haldane A.G., Who owns a company?, University of Edinburgh Corporate Finance Conference, (2015); Hausmann R., Hidalgo C., Bustos S., Et al., Country rankings, The Atlas of Economic Complexity: Mapping Paths to Prosperity: Mapping Paths to Prosperity, (2014); Inker B., Just how bad is emerging, and how good is the U.S.?, GMO Quarterly Letter 3Q, (2015); Weekly Insight: Waiting Game, 12 November, (2015); Global Financial Stability Report.

It examines the extent to which this renegotiation of the 'public service bargain' was necessitated by austerity requirements, and the extent to which the crisis provided an opportunity for the deprivileging of public employment that has been an enduring feature of the neoliberal state. A case study of the different approaches of two Queensland governments to their relationships with public sector workers between 2009 and 2014, it tracks two key measures of wages and staff numbers, as well as the consequences of breaches of the trust relationships of the traditional public sector bargain. Given the moderate nature of Australia's economic downturn, the implementation of public service austerity measures was less an economic necessity than an opportunity for a conservative government to alter employment policies and sever union relationships. This continuation of public sector employment relations favoured by previous conservative governments had electoral consequences. © University of New South Wales.","Austerity; collective bargaining; economic stimulus; employment conditions; employment security; global financial crisis; industrial/employment relations policy; neoliberalism; public sector bargain; trade unions","","Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), Labour Price Index Table 2a Total Hourly Rates of Pay Excluding Bonuses, All Sectors by State, Financial Year, ABS Cat No. 6345.0, (2007); Bach S., Bordogna L., Varieties of new public management or alternative models? the reform of public service employment relations in industrialized democracies, International Journal of Human Resource Management, 22, 11, pp. 2281-2294, (2011); Beattie P., Management of Public Service.

It begins by outlining the institutional arrangements under which minimum wage rates are determined in PNG. It then critically examines the argument that wage levels in the country are unsustainably high - a claim that has perennially characterised Papua New Guinea (PNG) minimum wage fixing. The article argues that, on the contrary, wage levels are indeed low and not adequate to reasonably support a single worker, let alone a family in an urban setting. This counter-argument is discussed in the context of debates over minimum wage levels and their relationship to economic growth, employment creation, international competitiveness, and capacity to pay. Whilst focusing on the PNG wage fixing system, the article thus sheds light on the dilemmas and challenges facing wages policy generally in a developing country setting. © The Author(s) 2015.","Central wage fixing; developing country; minimum wage; minimum wages board; Papua New Guinea","","Papua New Guinea, (2010); PNG employers support 6% minimum wage rise, ABC Radio Australia, (2014); PNG trade union wants minimum wage raised, ABC Radio Australia, (2014); Australian Government Aid.

Current austerity measures have coincided with the renewal of collective agreements, thus allowing the study of how unions link bargaining stances to wider issues of service quality and accessibility. Union responses are the result of at least three influences: the institutional framework for public sector collective bargaining and worker representation, the previous orientation of members and their organisations towards social and work relations, and ongoing innovations for renewal and member engagement. We posit that union responses can contribute to renewal if they are guided by concerns to redefine union purpose, union organisation and building capacities. Under these conditions, unions are able to engage members and push forward an alternative agenda to that of the government. In doing so, they may be able to forge temporary alliances with outside stakeholders, namely parents. Analysis of union responses should consider the dialectic between union renewal effort and the opportunities and constraints of the institutional framework for public sector collective bargaining. The challenge for these two labour federations is in sustaining member engagement and activism beyond the current context of collective bargaining. © University of New South Wales.","Austerity; collective bargaining; public education; public sector; teachers'; union renewal; union strategies","","Albo G., Evans B., From rescue strategies to exit strategies: the struggle over public sector austerity, Socialist Register, 47, pp. 283-308, (2011); Bach S., Bordogna L., Reframing public sector employment relations: the impact of economic crisis and the new EU economic governance, European Journal of Industrial Relations, 19, 4, pp. 279-324, (2013); Bach S., Givan R.K., Public service modernisation and trade union reform: towards managerial lead renewal?, Public Administration, 86, 2, pp. 523-539, (2008); Boivin J., Grenier J.-N., La négociation collective dans les secteurs public et parapublic au Québec, La Négociation Collective Au Québec, pp. 173-206, (2011); Camfield D., Renewal in Canadian public sector unions: neoliberalism and union praxis, Relations Industrielles/Industrial Relations, 62, 2, pp. 282-304, (2007); Camfield D., Renewing public sector unions, Public Sector Unions in the Age of Austerity, pp. 69-79, (2013); Cantin E., The politics of austerity and the conservative offensive against U.S. public sector unions, 2008-2012, Relations Industrielles/Industrial Relations, 67, 4, pp. 612-632, (2012); Collombat T., Labor and austerity in Québec: lessons from the maple spring, Labor Studies Journal, 39, 2, pp. 140-159, (2014); Eurofound, Industrial Relations in Central Public Administration: Recent Trends and Features, (2014); Eurofound, ERM Annual Report 2014: Restructuring in the Public Sector, (2015); European Trade Union Institute (ETUI), The public sector in the crisis, Working Paper 2010.07, (2010); Evans B., When your boss is the state: the paradoxes of public sector work, Public Sector Unions in the Age of Austerity, pp. 18-30, (2011); Fairbrother P., Social movement unionism or trade unions as social movements, Employee Responsibilities and Rights Journal, 20, 2, pp. 213-220, (2008); Fairbrother P., Rethinking trade unionism: union renewal as transition, Economic and Labour Relations Review, 26, 4, pp. 561-576, (2015); Fairbrother P., O'Brien J., Junor A., Et al., Unions and Globalisation: Governments, Management, and the State at Work, (2012); Federation des commissions scolaires du Quebec (FCSQ), Mémoire sur le Projet des Règles Budgétaires Pour l'Année Scolaire 2015-2016.

Both sectors have become notorious for depleting the stocks on which they depend, eroding the value of harvested natural resources over time and having significant negative 'by-catch' impacts on non-target natural resources. Problems of resource overuse and potential ecosystem collapse inherently derive from poor decisions influenced by those with undue or excessive economic, political and labour market power. Solutions to problems of unsustainability of resource management will need to engage with these economic drivers and beneficiaries, and require strategies including better and more independent assessments of the status and condition of resources. Deep-seated problems caused by resource over-commitment need more robust approaches to resource assessment that (1) better account for uncertainty (including uncertainty resulting from stock losses due to disturbance), (2) avoid ratchet effects and (3) provide appropriate ecological parameters for resource harvest. The United Nations framework for environmental and economic accounting methods can help assess the economic and other contributions of different resource-based industries and inform decisions about trade-offs between competing interests. Finally, there is value in examining successful and unsuccessful industry restructuring, in which decisions to transition away from demonstrably unsustainable resource industries have been made.

To investigate the impact of non-standard work schedules on young people's relationships, this article draws on data from 50 interviews conducted in 2008 and 4 surveys conducted between 2007 and 2012 with 636 young people (aged 18-24 years), all participating in the Life Patterns Project longitudinal study of youth in Australia. Over the 6 years, a majority of participants were engaged in non-standard work, working weekends, evenings or public holidays. A significant minority also faced weekly variability in their work schedules. The interview data suggest that these patterns of employment can be considered unsocial, making it more difficult to find regular periods of time together with a group of friends. Interview discussion also suggests that as a substitute for a greater quantity of shared time, some young people seek out shared experiences felt to be intense or out of the ordinary, such as that facilitated by alcohol consumption, to make the most of limited opportunities to bond with a group of close friends. © The Author(s) 2013.","A14; Alcohol; decent work; flexibility; friendship; health; non-standard employment; synchronisation; unsocial hours; work; youth","","Allan G., Flexibility, friendship and family, Personal Relationships, 15, 1, pp. 1-16, (2008); Andres A., Wyn J., The Making of A Generation: The Children of the 1970s in Adulthood, (2010); Arnett J.A., Emerging Adulthood: The Winding Road from the Late Teens Through the Twenties, (2004); Australian Social Trends 2005, (2005); Bittman M., Sunday working and family time, Labour & Industry, 16, 1, pp. 59-81, (2005); Boyd D., Ellison N., Social network sites: Definition, history, and scholarship, Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 13, 1, pp. 210-230, (2008); Campbell I., Casual work and casualisation: How does Australia compare?, Labour & Industry, 15, 2, pp. 85-111, (2004); Devlin M., James R., Grigg G., Studying and working: A national study of student finances and student engagement, Tertiary Education and Management, 14, 2, pp. 111-122, (2008); Du Gay P., Pryke M., Cultural Economy, (2002); Furlong A., Kelly P., The Brazilianisation of youth transitions in Australia and the UK?, Australian Journal of Social Issues, 40, 2, pp. 207-225, (2005); Furlong A., Woodman D., Wyn J., Changing times, changing perspectives: Reconciling 'transition' and 'cultural' perspectives on youth and young adulthood, Journal of Sociology, 47, 4, pp. 355-370, (2011); Gregg M., Work's Intimacy, (2011); Henderson S., Holland J., McGrellis S., Inventing Adulthoods: A Biographical Approach to Youth Transitions, (2007); Livingstone S., Taking risky opportunities in youthful content creation: Teenagers' use of social networking sites for intimacy, privacy and self-expression, New Media & Society, 10, 3, pp. 393-411, (2008); McNamara M., Bohle P., Quinlan M., Precarious employment, working hours, work-life conflict and health in hotel work, Applied Ergonomics, 42, 2, pp. 225-232, (2011); Marmot M., Wilkinson R., Social Determinants of Health, (1999); Measham F., Brain K., Binge' drinking, British alcohol policy and the new culture of intoxication, Crime, Media, Culture, 1, 3, pp. 263-284, (2005); Miles M.B., Huberman A.M., Qualitative Data Analysis, (1994); Pettinger L., Friends, relations and colleagues: The blurred boundaries of the workplace, Sociological Review, 53, 2, pp. 37-55, (2005); Pocock B., Skinner N., Williams P., Time Bomb: Work, Rest and Play in Australia Today, (2012); Price R., McDonald P., Bailey J., Young People and Work, pp. 1-17, (2011); Roberts B., Biographical Research, (2002); Shove E., Time, Consumption and Everyday Life, pp. 17-33, (2009); Skinner N., Pocock B., Work, life, flexibility and workplace culture in Australia: Results of the 2008 Australian Work and Life Index (AWALI) survey, Australian Bulletin of Labour, 36, 2, pp. 133-154, (2010); Southerton D., Time, Consumption and Everyday Life, pp. 49-63, (2009); Spencer L., Pahl R., Rethinking Friendship: Hidden Solidarities Today, (2006); Standing G., The Precariat: The New Dangerous Class, (2011); Symes C., Chronicles of labour: A discourse analysis of time diaries, Time & Society, 8, 23, pp. 357-380, (1999); Szmigin I., Griffin C., Mistral W., Re-framing 'binge drinking' as calculated hedonism: Empirical evidence from the UK, International Journal of Drug Policy, 19, 5, pp. 359-366, (2008); Thrift N., May J., Timespace: Geographies of Temporality, (2001); Urry J., Mobility and proximity, Sociology, 36, 2, pp. 255-274, (2002); Woodman D., Responsibility and time for escape: The meaning of wellbeing to young Australians, Melbourne Journal of Politics, 29, 1, pp. 82-95, (2004); Woodman D., Life out of synch: How new patterns of further education and the rise of precarious employment are reshaping young people's relationships, Sociology, 46, 6, pp. 1074-1090, (2012)","D.

The old system of minimum wage setting was based on a single nationwide minimum wage which was differentiated across regions and occupations via a cumbersome framework of coefficients. The new system is a mixture of the government-set minimum wage at the federal level and collective agreements at the regional level. We show that the system of minimum wage setting has become more flexible. The reform succeeded in raising the real value of the minimum wage and increasing earnings of low-paid workers without causing significant negative effects in terms of employment. The reform did not lead to greater regional variation of minimum wages. Nevertheless, it introduced some new imbalances: an unintended consequence of the reform was the emergence of separate regional wage sub-minima for private and public sector workers in many regions. The major challenge in coming years is to strengthen the institutions of collective bargaining, introduce evidence-based evaluation and boost the capacities of government and non-government monitoring agencies. © University of New South Wales.","Collective bargaining; decentralisation; employer organisations; minimum wage; Russia; social partners; unions; wage distribution; wage policy; wage setting","","Aghion P., Agan Y., Cahuc P., Can policy interact with culture?

At the same time, right-populist discourses and movements have arisen in ways that give both legitimacy and voice to the politics of austerity. Toronto, Canada, provides a world-renowned case of populist experimentation at the metropolitan scale, as the actions of Mayor Rob Ford typified this nexus of austerity and populism. Set in the context of Ford's term as Mayor of Toronto (2010-2014), this article asks how the combined rise of austerity and right populism creates both new challenges and new opportunities for public sector labour in urban spaces. We argue that public sector unions are central in both the making and unmaking of populist austerity and identify potential trajectories for organised labour in the face of the continuation of austerity-driven politics. © University of New South Wales.","Austerity; Canada; neoliberal urbanism; populism; public sector unions","","Albertazzi D., McDonnell D., Twenty-First Century Populism: The Spectre of Western European Democracy, (2008); Albo G., Gindin S., Panitch L., In and out of Crisis: The Global Financial Meltdown and Left Alternatives, (2010); Annunziato F., Gramsci's theory of trade unionism, Rethinking Marxism, 1, pp. 142-164, (1988); Bascaramurty D., Soknacki campaign prepares to drop the gloves in Toronto mayoral battle, The Globe and Mail, (2014); Berlet C., Lyons M., Right-Wing Populism in America: Too Close for Comfort, (2000); Bourdieu P., Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste, (1984); Boutilier A., Conservatives will push for sick-leave reform despite report's findings, The Toronto Star, (2014); Brenner N., Theodore N., Cities and the geographies of 'actually existing neoliberalism, Antipode, 34, 3, pp. 349-379, (2002); Bryan D., Australian populism and the global financial crisis: finding a place for labour, Labour & Industry, 20, 3, pp. 250-269, (2010); Camfield D., Neoliberalism and working-class resistance in British Columbia: the Hospital Employees' Union struggle, 2002-2004, Labouring Canada: Class, Gender, and Race in Canadian Working-Class History, pp. 444-460, (2008); Camfield D., Canadian Labour in Crisis: Reinventing the Workers' Movement, (2011); The Benefits of Public Solid Waste Services: Lessons for Toronto, (2015); Canovan M., Populism, (1981); Carson J., Fair wages and city cleaners: the battle for a living wage in Toronto, Rabble, (2013); Carson J., Siemiatyki M., Resisting precarity in Toronto's municipal sector: the justice and dignity for cleaners campaign, Just Labour, 22, pp. 168-185, (2014); Chopra D., Protecting Canada Post's future, Canada Post, (2014); Toronto Industry Profiles 2013, (2013); Public Services for Ontarians: A Path to Sustainability and Excellence, (2012); D'Eramo M., Populism and the new oligarchy, New Left Review, 82, pp. 5-28, (2013); Doolittle R., Library strike a messy dilemma for Mayor Rob Ford and negotiators, Toronto Star, (2012); Fanelli C., Toronto civic workers bargaining without a base: the significance of 2012, Studies in Social Justice, 8, 2, pp. 119-143, (2014); Fanelli C., Thomas M., Austerity, competitiveness and neoliberalism redux: Ontario responds to the great recession, Socialist Studies, 7, 12, pp. 141-170, (2011); Flack D., Tim Hortons vs. Toronto public libraries mashup, BlogTO, (2011); Frederiksen L., Our public library: social reproduction and urban public space in Toronto, Women's Studies International Forum, 48, pp. 141-153, (2015); Gillis C., Lunau K., Toronto stinks: the festering trash is just another sign that the city's high hopes are being held ransom by out-of-control costs, Maclean's, (2009); Government of Canada, Bill C-377: An Act to Amend the Income Tax Act (Requirements for Labour Organizations), (2013); Gramsci A., Unsigned l'ordine nuovo., 12 June 1920.

Previous literature has concluded that part-time workers suffer a wage penalty, but its magnitude varies across studies and countries. The part-time penalty is the otherwise unexplained element of the gap between full-time and part-time hourly earnings. One potential factor accounting for international differences in this penalty is the coverage of collective bargaining. This article outlines research examining wage differences between part-time and full-time male and female workers in Spain, a country with a very high level of coverage of collective agreements but very heterogeneous regional labour markets. Results are obtained using an econometric decomposition specifically adapted to matched employer-employee data. They show that intra-firm wage differentials for part- and full-time workers with the same characteristics are negligible. But results that are perhaps less expected are those based on the regional analysis - an unprecedented perspective compared with the previous literature. These results show that despite very significant differences in economies and labour markets, observed wage gaps between part-time and full-time workers in each Spanish region are also mainly explained by different endowments of individual, job and firm characteristics. Overall, our evidence highlights the over-riding role of wage setting mechanisms, specifically collective bargaining coverage, in minimising inter-regional differences in the wage penalty of part-time workers. © University of New South Wales.","Collective bargaining; part-time work; regional differences; Spain; unexplained wage penalty; wage gap","","Ayuda M.I., Collantes F., Pinilla V.J., Long-run regional population disparities in Europe during modern economic growth: A case study of Spain, Annals of Regional Science, 44, 2, pp. 273-295, (2010); Bande R., Fernandez R., Montuenga V., Regional unemployment in Spain: Disparities, business cycle and wage setting, Labor Economics, 15, 5, pp. 885-914, (2008); Belous R., The Contingent Economy: The Growth of the Temporary, Part-Time and Subcontracted Workforce, (1989); Bentolila S., Sticky labor in Spanish regions, European Economic Review, 41, 3-5, pp. 591-598, (1997); Booth A.L., Wood M., Back-to-front down under?

The argument developed here is that their reasoning is not, any more than that of their heterodox critics, independent of ideology, power and ethics. The widespread belief in austerity policies as scientifically justified has prevented arguments against austerity gaining more traction; issues of ideology, power and ethics need to be brought to the fore as part of the arguments on both sides. In other words, awareness of the epistemological issues arising from an open-system ontology is critical to understanding the crisis and the policy response, and therefore to challenging that understanding and encouraging a radical policy shift. The critique of austerity policies would therefore be strengthened by a critique of the mainstream's rhetorical (mis)representation of economic theorising. © The Author(s) 2015.","Belief; fiscal austerity; science","","Ball L., Mankiw N.G., What Do Budget Deficits Do?, (1996); Blaug M., The Methodology of Economics, or How Economists Explain, (1980); Blyth M., Austerity: The History of A Dangerous Idea, (2013); Boumans M., Davis J.B., Economic Methodology: Understanding Economics As A Science, (2010); Boyer R., The four fallacies of contemporary austerity policies: The lost Keynesian legacy, Cambridge Journal of Economics, 36, 1, pp. 283-312, (2012); Buchanan M., Forecast: What Physics, Meteorology and the Natural Sciences Can Teach Us about Economics, (2013); Callinicos A., Contradictions of austerity, Cambridge Journal of Economics, 36, 1, pp. 65-78, (2012); Chick V., Keynes, Knowledge and Uncertainty, pp. 25-42, (1995); Chick V., Pettifor A., The Economic Consequences of Mr Osborne.

It then gives a genealogy of European economic policy responses to the crisis, tracing them from the emerging 'freshwater' school of economics (e.g. University of Chicago) that arose in opposition to Keynesian theory. The more immediate cause of the 2008 crisis, long in the making, was its reliance on private debt to sustain economic demand in light of profit-enhancing wage suppression. Following the 2008 financial shock, European Union policymakers crafted policy that placed the burden of adjustment on labour. A programme of austerity was chosen in much of the European Union, at odds with the post-war European 'social model'. This represented a retreat from the notion of a European project that encouraged liberalisation of economic policy but at the same time could be harmonised with a social dimension to create a distinctive 'Social Europe'. Nowhere was this austerity more vigorously applied than in the Baltic states. Its effects are examined here, along with lessons to be derived from that experience. © The Author(s) 2014.","austerity; Baltic states; Global financial crisis; migration; neoliberalism","","Amadeo K., National Debt by Year Compared to GDP, Recessions and Other Major Events.

The fiscal consolidation imposed by the European Union on highly indebted countries was based on the assumptions of so-called expansionary austerity. However, the reality so far provides proof to the contrary, and the results outlined in this article support the opposing view of a self-defeating austerity. Based on a model of the input-output relations of the productive system, an unemployment rate/budget balance trade-off equation is derived, as well as the impact of a strong fiscal consolidation based on social transfers and the notion of a neutral budget balance. An application to the Portuguese case confirms the huge costs of a strong fiscal consolidation, both in terms of unemployment and social policy regress. The conclusion is that too much consolidation in anyone year makes consolidation more difficult in the following year. © University of New South Wales.","Austerity; fiscal consolidation; input-output analysis; Portugal; self-defeating austerity; unemployment","","Alesina A., Ardagna S., Large Changes in Fiscal Policy: Taxes Versus Spending, (2009); Amaral J.F., Lopes J.C., The Trade-off Unemployment Rate/external Deficit: Assessing the Economic Adjustment Program of the Troika (European Commission, ECB and IMF) for Portugal Using An Input-output Approach, (2015); Amaral J.F., Lopes J.C., Forecasting errors by the Troika in the Economic Adjustment Program for Portugal, Cambridge Journal of Economics, (2016); Andres J., Domenech R., Budget balance, structural unemployment and fiscal adjustments: The Spanish case, VoxEU.org, (2013); Bahce S.A., Memi E., The impact of the economic crisis on joblessness in Turkey, Economic and Labour Relations Review, 25, 1, pp. 130-153, (2014); Blanchard O.J., Leigh D., Growth Forecast Errors and Fiscal Multipliers.

After overviewing aggregate youth unemployment trends in several European countries, we focus on Russia and Italy - countries with contrasting structural and institutional conditions and exhibiting different macroeconomic trends - in order to determine whether, despite these differences, there were similar patterns in the relationship between individual and family characteristics and the of risk of unemployment and its adverse impacts. We use a Heckman probit model to estimate the unemployment risk of young people - compared to adults - during the period 2004-2011, before and after the global financial crisis. Despite many differences between the two countries, most of the explanatory variables acted in the same direction in each and so we compare the relative size of such effects. The policy significance of the findings is that personal and family characteristics are more amenable to modification than macroeconomic variables. Specific school-to-work interventions are needed to avoid creating a 'lost generation'. © University of New South Wales.","Global financial crisis; Heckman probit; individual determinants of unemployment; Italy; long-term unemployment; regional unemployment; Russia; school to work transition; youth unemployment","","Addabbo T., Rodriguez-Modrono P., Galvez-Munoz L., Youth Living in A Couple: How Women's Labour Supply Adapts to the Crisis. the Case of Spain, (2013); Arpaia A., Curci N., EU Labour Market Behaviour during the Great Recession, (2010); Bassanini A., Duval R., Unemployment, institutions, and reform complementarities: Re-assessing the aggregate evidence for OECD countries, Oxford Review of Economic Policy, 25, 1, pp. 40-59, (2009); Bell D.N.F., Blanchflower D.G., Young people and the great recession, Oxford Review of Economic Policy, 27, 2, pp. 241-267, (2011); Blanchflower D.G., Freeman R.B., Youth Employment and Joblessness in Advanced Countries, (2000); Bruno G., Marelli E., Signorelli M., The rise of NEET and youth unemployment in EU regions after the crisis, Comparative Economic Studies, 56, 4, pp. 592-615, (2014); Caroleo F.E., Pastore F., The Youth Experience Gap: Explaining Differences Across EU Countries, (2007); Choudry M.T., Marelli E., Signorelli M., Et al., Youth unemployment rate and impact of financial crises, International Journal of Manpower, 33, 1, pp. 76-95, (2012); Demidova O., Marelli E., Signorelli M., Spatial effects on youth unemployment rate: The case of Eastern and Western Russian regions, Eastern European Economics, 51, 5, pp. 94-124, (2013); Demidova O., Marelli E., Signorelli M., Youth labour market performance in the Russian and Italian Regions, Economic Systems, 39, 1, pp. 43-58, (2014); De Santis M., Il rapporto tra i giovani e il mercato del lavoro: La difficile condizione nel Mezzogiorno, Rivista Economica Del Mezzogiorno, 22, 3-4, pp. 713-734, (2008); Destefanis S., Mastromatteo G., Labour-market performance in the OECD: Some recent cross-country evidence, International Journal of Manpower, 31, 7, pp. 713-731, (2010); Employment and Unemployment (Labour Force Survey), (2014); Gimpelson V.E., Kapelyushnikov R.I., Lukyanova A., Employment protection legislation in Russia: Regional enforcement and labor market outcomes, Comparative Economic Studies, 52, 4, pp. 611-636, (2010); Chapter 3.

In modern microeconomics, behavioural economic analysis has flourished, focusing on individual responses and interactions. By contrast, in macroeconomics, humans are assumed to behave as if they are mathematical machines, making decisions in a mechanical, objective way. From this perspective, it is difficult to properly capture the instabilities that characterise modern macroeconomies and financial systems. While some progress has been made in recognising the bounds to rationality, the complexity of the macroeconomy can be captured fully only by embedding psychological and sociological forces more fully into macroeconomic models. Keynes was a pioneer in analysing the impacts of socio-psychological influences on macroeconomic phenomena. This article explores some of Keynes' fundamental ideas about socio-psychological macroeconomic influences, including insights from A Treatise on Probability (1921) onwards, and links these insights both with modern behavioural economic theory and current macroeconomic policy debates. © University of New South Wales.","B22;

In this article, we argue that financialisation in Australia has advanced inequality, but in a particular way. Charting several features of ‘financialisation of the macroeconomy’, we accept that this process has contributed to increased inequality in the sense that the wealthy have increased their wealth faster than households and individuals at the lower end of the wealth distribution. However, there is limited Australian evidence to suggest that income redistribution has occurred as a result of the ‘financialisation of the firm’. At the level of the firm, increased inequality of wealth can be attributed directly to financialisation if firm practices are oriented to increasing shareholder value at the expense of returns to other stakeholders such as workers or suppliers, and increased income inequality can be linked specifically to financialisation through increases in earnings to financial agents. We suggest several reasons for the relative absence of a firm-level dimension of financialisation but caution that such a trend remains possible, particularly if regulation of the labour market is weakened. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Financialisation of the firm; financialisation of the macroeconomy; income redistribution; inequality; investment; wealth distribution","","Australian National Accounts: finance and wealth, (2014); Managed funds, Australia, (2014); Australian System of National Accounts.

We first model unemployment spell as a function of individual and household characteristics and work attitudes and preferences using a discrete-time duration method. Then, we estimate the survival probabilities to examine the potential existence of employment scarring. The results provide some evidence for the potential presence of employment scarring in the three countries. The scars are largest in Serbia for all durations of the unemployment spell followed by Macedonia; they are weakest in Montenegro. © University of New South Wales.","Long-term unemployment; scarring; transition economies; youth unemployment","","Arulampalam W., Gregg P., Gregory M., Unemployment scarring, The Economic Journal, 111, 475, pp. 577-584, (2001); Baah-Boateng W., The youth unemployment challenge in Africa: What are the drivers?, The Economic and Labour Relations Review, 27, 4, pp. 413-431, (2016); Bartlett W., Fetsi A., Economic restructuring, job creation and the changing demand for skills in the Western Balkans, Labour Markets in the Western Balkans: Challenges for the Future, pp. 19-50, (2007); Becker G., Investment in human capital: A theoretical analysis, Journal of Political Economy, 70, 5, pp. 9-49, (1962); Box-Steffensmeier J.M., Jones B.S., Event History Modeling: A Guide for Social Scientists, (2004); Cockx B., Picchio M., Scarring effects of remaining unemployed for long-term unemployed school-leavers, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A: Statistics in Society, 176, 4, pp. 951-980, (2013); Cruces G., Ham A., Viollaz M., Scarring Effects of Youth Unemployment and Informality: Evidence from Brazil, (2012); Cunningham W., Salvagno J.B., Youth Employment Transitions in Latin America, (2011); Djuric D., Labour Market Transitions of Young Women and Men in Montenegro, (2016); Labour Market and Labour Force Survey (LFS) Statistics, (2016); Fares J., Tiongson E., Youth Unemployment, Labor Market Transitions, and Scarring: Evidence from Bosnia and Herzegovina 2001-04, (2007); Fougere D., Kramarz F., Pouget J., Youth unemployment and crime in France, Journal of the European Economic Association, 7, 5, pp. 909-938, (2009); Gasparini L., Tornaroli L., Labor informality in Latin America and the Caribbean: Patterns and trends from household survey microdata, Desarrollo y Sociedad, 63, 1, pp. 13-80, (2009); Gregg P., The impact of youth unemployment on adult unemployment in the NCDS, The Economic Journal, 111, 475, pp. 626-653, (2001); Gregg P., Tominey E., The wage scar from youth unemployment, Labour Economics, 12, 4, pp. 487-509, (2005); Hensher D.A., Mannering F.L., Hazard-based duration models and their application to transport analysis, Transport Reviews, 14, 1, pp. 63-82, (1994); School-to-Work Transition Survey (SWTS), (2014); IMF Executive Board Approves €1.2 Billion Stand-by Arrangement for Serbia, (2015); Junankar P.N., The impact of the global financial crisis on youth unemployment, The Economic and Labour Relations Review, 26, 2, pp. 191-217, (2015); Kiefer N.M., Economic duration data and hazard functions, Journal of Economic Literature, 26, 2, pp. 646-679, (1988); Kokotovic F., An empirical study of factors influencing total unemployment rate in comparison to youth unemployment rate in selected EU member-states, Theoretical and Applied Economics, 23, 3, pp. 79-92, (2016); Kollmann R., The duration of unemployment as a signal, Economics Letters, 45, pp. 373-377, (1994); Lancaster T., The Economic Analysis of Transition Data, (1990); Lockwood B., Information externalities in the labor market and the duration of unemployment, The Review of Economic Studies, 58, 4, pp. 733-753, (1991); Lupi C., Ordine P., Unemployment scarring in high unemployment regions, Economics Bulletin, 10, 2, pp. 1-8, (2002); Marelli E., Vakulenko E., Youth unemployment in Italy and Russia: Aggregate trends and individual determinants, The Economic and Labour Relations Review, 27, 3, pp. 387-405, (2016); Marjanovic D., Labour Market Transitions of Young Women and Men in the Republic of Serbia, (2016); Employment and Social Reform Programme Montenegro 2015-2020, (2015); Mojsoska-Blazevski N., The Public Employment, Education and Labour Markets in Macedonia, (2005); Mojsoska-Blazevski N., Labour Market Transitions of Young Women and Men in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia: Results of the 2014 School-to-Work Transition Survey, (2016); Mooi-Reci I., Ganzeboom H.B., Unemployment scarring by gender: Human capital depreciation or stigmatization?

Using panel data for 15 Tunisian sectors over the period 1983-2010, we compare estimated sectoral output-employment elasticities prior to and following the Free Trade Agreement process with the European Union. The results provide evidence that trade liberalisation in Tunisia has led to an increase in the intensity of employment in exporting manufacturing sectors like textiles, clothing and leather industries, and mechanical and electrical industries. However, their ability to generate jobs in response to value-added growth remains weak. Conversely, since the Free Trade Agreement process, the most labour-intensive service sectors, notably tourism and miscellaneous services, have shown a significant decrease in the employment intensity of their output growth. Our findings suggest that the Free Trade Agreement with the European Union has not really fostered the shift of the Tunisian Economy towards a more inclusive model and support the argument for a reorientation of investment policy in favour of sectors generating more job opportunities. © The Author(s) 2015.","Employment intensity; jobless growth; panel data; sectoral output; trade liberalisation; Tunisia","","Ajilore T., Yinusa O., An analysis of employment intensity of sectoral output growth in Botswana, Southern African Business Review, 5, 2, pp. 26-42, (2011); Aydiner-Avsar N., Onaran O., The determinants of employment: A sectoral analysis for Turkey, The Developing Economies, 48, 2, pp. 203-231, (2010); Baldwin R.E., The Effect of Trade and Foreign Direct Investment on Employment and Relative Wages, (1995); Boltho A., Glyn A., Can macroeconomic policies raise employment?, International Labour Review, 134, 45, pp. 451-470, (1995); Christev A., Kupets O., Lehmann H., Trade liberalisation and employment effects in Ukraine, Comparative Economic Studies, 50, 2, pp. 318-340, (2008); Crivelli E., Furceri D., Toujas-Bernate J., Can Policies Affect Employment Intensity of Growth?

The aim of this article is to build on this previous research using the 2006 and 2011 censuses to provide a more disaggregated descriptive analysis of changes in the character of labour market outcomes for Indigenous Australians aged 15-64 years. One of the new findings in the article is that the employment of Indigenous youth (i.e. those aged 15-24 years) in remote areas is different from that of Indigenous youth in non-remote areas, but older Indigenous residents of such areas are not very different in employment terms. Policy-makers thus need to pay particular attention to Indigenous youth employment in remote areas because the failure to address these differentials may lead to a foreclosure of future labour market options. Policy also needs to facilitate Indigenous engagement in the mainstream economy by assisting Indigenous people to be work-ready, especially in ensuring that Indigenous skills are matched with employer demands, and expediting employment by informing businesses on how to provide an Indigenous-friendly workplace. © The Author(s) 2014.","Indigenous employment; labour force and employment; public policy; regional labour markets","","Altman J.C., Evidently: Finding the Truth in the Employment Gap, (2013); Census Dictionary, 2011, (2011); Australian Demographic Statistics, (2012); Labour Force Characteristics of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, (2012); Estimates of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, (2013); Labour Force, Australia, (2013); Closing the Gap Prime minister''s Report 2013, (2013); Biddle N., Education Part 2: School Education, (2013); Biddle N., Hunter B., An analysis of the internal migration of Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, Australian Journal of Labour Economics, 9, 4, pp. 321-341, (2006); Daly A., The Employment of Aboriginal Australians in the Labour Market, (1991); Ehrenberg R.G., Smith R.S., Modern Labour Economics: Theory and Public Policy, (2003); Foley D., Indigenous Australian Entrepreneurs: Not Community and Not in the Outback, (2006); Gray M., Hunter B., Changes in Indigenous Labour Force Status: Establishing Employment As A Social Norm?, (2011); Gray M., Howlett M., Hunter B., Labour Market Outcomes, (2013); Gray M., Hunter B., Howlett M., Indigenous Employment: A Story of Continuing Growth, (2013); Gray M., Hunter B., Lohoar S., Increasing Indigenous Employment Rates, (2012); Hunter B., Indigenous Australians in the Contemporary Labour Market, (2004); Hunter B., Daly A., The labour supply of Indigenous Australian females: The effects of fertility and interactions with the justice system, Journal of Population Research, 30, 1, pp. 1-18, (2013); Hunter B., Gray M., Indigenous labour supply following a period of strong economic growth, Australian Journal of Labour Economics, 15, 2, pp. 141-159, (2012); Hunter B., Gray M., Continuity and change in the CDEP scheme, Australian Journal of Social Issues, 48, 1, pp. 35-56, (2013); Hunter B., Taylor J., Indigenous Labour Force Status to the Year 2000: Estimated Impacts of Recent Budget Cuts, (1996); Trends in Australian Agriculture, (2005); Sanders W., Coombs' bastard child: The troubled life of the CDEP scheme, Australian Journal of Public Administration, 71, 4, pp. 371-391, (2012)","","","SAGE Publications Ltd","10353046","","","","English","Econ.

However, education systems pay only limited attention to this topic in most countries and remain focused on the development of hard skills. Is this approach rational or inadequate? This article provides new evidence on different aspects of the wage returns to soft skills (as an approximation of their productivity), and thereby contributes significantly to the discussion of the role of educational institutions in their development. It provides evidence that soft skills are as productive as hard skills. Moreover, it suggests that the productivity of hard skills stems from their combination with soft skills. These conclusions do not correspond to the fact that the value of education is intermediated mainly by hard skills, resulting in unequal development of soft and hard skills in schools. While concluding that education systems should pay more attention to soft skills development, the analysis recognises that this attention should be differentiated according to employers' needs, owing to substantial differences in the value of soft skills across economic sectors. It is also noteworthy that while significant gender differences in returns to hard skills were identified, wage returns to soft skills appear gender neutral.

This article argues first that the Eurozone policy framework can be viewed as neo-liberalism overlaid with policy constraints associated with a mis-specified Optimum Currency Area. We are critical of this framework since it is incompatible with the policy sovereignty that is experienced, if not utilised, by sovereign economies such as the USA, UK and Australia. Second, recent and proposed policy reforms which generally lie within the constraints of the Eurozone framework are examined. We conclude that these policies are piecemeal and fail to restore policy sovereignty, which ultimately requires that member countries exit the Eurozone. Key issues associated with such an exit are briefly discussed. © The Author(s) 2014.","European Monetary Union; fiscal and monetary policy; Global Financial Crisis; sovereignty","","Allard C., Brooks P.K., Bluedorn J.C., Toward A Fiscal Union for the Euro Area, (2013); Amato M., Fantacci L., The End of Finance, (2012); Athanassiou P., Withdrawal and Expulsion from the EU and EMU: Some Reflections, (2009); Auerback M., A(nother) Proposal for Saving the Euro Zone: Guest Post by Marshall Auerback, (2012); Beck T., Banking Union for Europe - Where Do We Stand?VoxEU.org, (2013); Beck T., Gros D., Schoenmaker D., Banking Union Instead of Eurobonds - Disentangling Sovereign and Banking Crises, (2012); Constancio V., Challenges to monetary policy in 2012, Speech at the 26th International Conference on Interest Rates, (2011); De Grauwe P., Moesen W., Gains for all: A proposal for a common Eurobond, CEPS Studies, (2009); Delors J., Andriessen F., Boyer M., Report on Economic and Monetary Union in the European Community, (1989); Delors J., Chair, Committee for the Study of Economic and Monetary Union, Report on Economic and Monetary Union in the European Community, (1989); Delpla J., Von Weizsacker J., The blue bond proposal, Bruegel Policy Briefs, (2010); Enderlein H., Bofinger P., Boone L., Et al., Completing the Euro: A road map towards fiscal union in Europe, Report of the Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa Group, (2012); European Central Bank (ECB), Banking Supervision, (2013); European Commission, Report of the Study Group on the Role of Public Finance in European Integration Studies: Economic and Fiscal Series, (1977); Green Paper on the Feasibility of Introducing Stability Bonds, (2011); Towards A Genuine Economic and Monetary Union, (2012); On the European Central Bank annual report for 2012, (2013); Feldstein M.S., The Euro and European Economic Conditions, (2011); Felipe J., Kumar U., Unit Labor Costs in the Eurozone: The Competitiveness Debate Again, (2011); Fitoussi J.P., Saraceno F., European economic governance: The Berlin-Washington consensus, Cambridge Journal of Economics, 37, 3, pp. 479-496, (2013); Friedman M., The Euro: Monetary Unity to Political Disunity?Project Syndicate, (1997); Ingham G., New Perspectives on Emotions in Finance, pp. 121-139, (2013); World Economic Outlook: Hopes, Realities, Risks, (2013); World Economic Outlook: Transitions and Tensions, (2013); Juniper J., Sharpe T.P., Watts M.J., Paper Presented at the 1st World Keynes Conference; Keynes J.M., A Treatise on Money, (1976); Knapp G.F., The State Theory of Money, (1985); Liikanen E., Report of the High-level Expert Group on Reforming the Structure of the EU Banking Sector, (2012); McCracken P.W., Carli G., Giersch H., Marjolin R., Matthews R., Karaosmanaglu A., Komiya R., Lindbeck A., Towards Full Employment and Price Stability, (1977); Mazier J., Petit P., In search of sustainable paths for the Eurozone in the troubled post-2008 world, Cambridge Journal of Economics, 37, 3, pp. 513-532, (2013); Minsky H.P., Stabilizing An Unstable Economy, (1986); Mitchell W.F., The buffer stock employment model and the NAIRU: The path to full employment, Journal of Economic Issues, 32, 2, pp. 547-555, (1998); Mitchell W.F., Flawed Macroeconomic Models Lead to Erroneous Conclusions, (2012); Mitchell W.F., A Greek Exit Would Not Cause Havoc, (2012); Mitchell W.F., Currency Sovereignty is What Matters, (2013); Mundell R.A., A theory of optimum currency areas, The American Economic Review, 51, 4, pp. 657-665, (1961); Nordvig J., Firoozye N., Rethinking the European Monetary Union, Wolfs on Economics Prize 2012 - Final Submission, (2012); Onaran O., Galanis G., Is Aggregate Demand Wage-Led or Profit-Led?

With the number of Working Holiday visa grants now topping 200,000 annually, Working Holiday Makers are significant participants in low-skilled work in Australia. The article argues that the programme is not adequately regulated to protect Working Holiday Makers in this work. In light of concerns around the exploitation of Working Holiday Makers, the article offers suggestions for reform to the programme. The article argues that the programme should be returned to its original conception of fostering a cultural experience for young migrants coming to Australia. It argues that work entitlements under the Working Holiday visa should be limited to work that is appropriate for young migrants on a brief cultural visit and that labour shortages should otherwise be filled using dedicated temporary labour migration visas which are properly designed to address labour shortages in the economy. Reform is necessary to protect the work conditions of local and migrant workers, to maintain Australias reputation as a country with high employment standards and to maintain positive relations with countries in the Working Holiday programme. © © The Author(s) 2015.","Labour markets; labour rights; migrant workers; migration; vulnerable workers","","Adler J., Youth on the road: Reflections on the history of tramping, Annals of Tourism Research, 12, 3, pp. 335-354, (1985); Anderson B., Migration, immigration controls and the fashioning of precarious workers, Work, Employment & Society, 24, 2, pp. 300-317, (2010); Labour Migration, Skills and Student Mobility in Asia, (2014); The Importance of the Working Holiday Visa (Subclass 417), (2012); Benhabib S., The Rights of Others: Aliens, Residents and Citizens, (2004); Birrell B., Healy H., Immigration Overshoot, (2012); Bosniak L., The Citizen and the Alien: Dilemmas of Contemporary Membership, (2006); Campbell I., Thornley C., Jeffreys S., Appay B., The rise of precarious employment and union responses in Australia, Globalization and Precarious Forms of Production and Employment: Challenges for Workers and Unions, pp. 114-132, (2010); Carens J., Aliens and citizens: The case for open borders, The Review of Politics, 49, pp. 251-273, (1987); Castles S., Miller M.J., The Age of Migration: International Population Movements in the Modern World, (2009); Castles S., De Haas H., Miller D., Age of Migration: International Population Movements in the Modern World, (2014); Fact Sheet: Temporary Foreign Worker Program, (2014); Research and Statistics, (2014); Migration Regulation Amendments 2005 (No 9) Regulatory Impact Statement: Changes to the Migration Regulations: Proposals to Expand the Working Holiday Makers Program (Supplementary Material), (2005); Amendments Relating to the Working Holiday Maker Visa Program, (2014); Annual Report 2013-14, (2014); Proposal Paper: Simplification of the Skilled Migration and Temporary Activity Visa Programmes, (2014); Visitor Visa Quarterly Report, Quarter Ending at 30 June 2014, (2014); Working Holiday Maker Report 2013-14, (2014); Procedures Advice Manual 3, 14, (1996); Fair Work Ombudsman to Review Entitlements of Overseas Visa Holders on Working Holidays, (2014); Guthrie R., Tourists overstaying their welcome: When the visa runs out and the workers stay on, The Tourism Industry, 6, pp. 1-16, (2004); Harding G., Webster E., The Working Holiday Maker Scheme and the Australian Labour Market, (2002); Ho C., Lin P., Huang S., Exploring Taiwanese Working Holiday-Makers motivations: An analysis of means-end hierarchies, Journal of Hospitality & Tourism Research, (2012); Tier 5 (Youth Mobility Scheme), 8 July, (2014); Howe J., Reilly A., Australia has outsourced migration to the private sector, The Conversation, (2014); Jarvis J., Peel V., Tourists for hire: International working holidaymakers in a work based destination in regional Australia, Tourism Management, 37, pp. 114-124, (2013); Working Holiday Makers: More Than Tourists, August, (1997); Lee I., Lee T., Perceived value and satisfaction of the Working Holiday Program in Australia, CAUthe 2013: Tourism and Global Change: On the Edge of Something Big Conference Proceedings, (2013); Marsden S., The new precariousness: Temporary migrants and the law in Canada, Canadian Journal of Law and Society, 27, pp. 209-229, (2012); Migrants in Low Skilled Work, July, (2014); Ong A., Flexible Citizenship: The Cultural Logics of Transnationality, (2004); Reilly A., Protecting vulnerable migrant workers: The case of international students, Australian Journal of Labour Law, 25, 3, pp. 181-208, (2012); Robertson S., Time and temporary migration: The case of temporary graduate workers and Working Holiday Makers in Australia, Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies, 40, 12, pp. 1915-1933, (2014); Ruhs M., The Price of Rights: Regulating International Labor Migration, (2013); Salt J., International Migration and the United Kingdom: Report of the United Kingdom SOPEMI Correspondent to the OECD, (2013); Tan Y., Lester L., Labour market and economic impacts of international working holiday temporary migrants to Australia, Population, Space and Place, 18, 3, pp. 359-383, (2012); Tan Y., Richardson S., Lester L., National Evaluation of Australias Working Holiday Maker Program, (2009); Uriely N., Travelling workers and working tourists: Variations across the interaction between work and tourism, International Journal of Tourism Research, 3, 1, pp. 1-8, (2001); Vosko L., MacDonald M., Campbell I., Vosko L., MacDonald M., Campbell I., Introduction: Gender and the concept of precarious employment, Gender and the Contours of Precarious Employment, pp. 1-25, (2009); Weil D., Pyles A., Why complain?

First, it outlines the policy reasons necessitating such legislation. Empirical evidence confirms that global value chains are a dominant feature of the global economy. It is contended that lead firms wield influence in global value chains in a manner which leads to poor outcomes for offshore workers. Second, the article sets out the minimum steps necessary for a domestic state to attribute the responsibility for transparency of global value chains to lead firms. Then, it proceeds to explore the possibilities and limits of the proposed scheme of regulation. Despite some complexities with implementing the scheme, it is argued that if domestic legislative regulation of global value chains strengthens even to a small extent the monitoring of global labour issues, it is worth pursuing. © The Author(s) 2015.","Globalisation; industrial/employment relations policy; labour rights; non-standard employment; occupational health; occupational safety; precarious work; supply chain; vulnerable workers","","Anner M., Newsome K., Taylor P., Bair J., Et al., Social downgrading and worker resistance in apparel global value chains, Putting Labour in Its Place: Labour Process Analysis and Global Value Chains, pp. 152-170, (2015); Anner M., Bair J., Blasi J., Toward joint liability in global value chains: Addressing the root causes of labor violations in international subcontracting networks, Comparative Labor Law and Policy Journal, 35, 1, pp. 1-44, (2013); Report Calls for More Transparency on Rights of Offshore Workers, 24 June, (2013); Backer K.D., Miroudot S., Mapping Global Value Chains, (2013); Bair J., Global capitalism and commodity chains: Looking back, going forward, Competition and Change, 9, 2, pp. 153-180, (2005); Bair J., Werner M., Newsome K., Taylor P., Bair J., Et al., Global production and uneven development: When bringing labour in isn't enough, Putting Labour in Its Place: Labour Process Analysis and Global Value Chains, pp. 119-134, (2015); The Truth behind the Barcode.

Jacinto Street, Philippines; Sale A.B., Human Resource Management/Industrial Relations Practitioner, Philippines","In the first decade of the present century, a succession of changes to Philippine labour law and jurisprudence sought to contribute to productivity and social welfare by introducing greater industrial relations flexibility, based on collective bargaining and voluntary dispute settlement. The article examines whether these changes actually resulted in any shift from a rights-based system for resolving industrial disputation to a system based on workplace-level interest-based negotiation, and whether they were accompanied either by higher labour productivity or by improved social welfare. The analysis draws on a conceptual framework that identifies coherent national labour regulation systems as being based on a convergence of three institutional approaches - to the operation of labour markets, of labour relations and of social security. Broadly, such labour regulation systems can be classified as either civil law or common law based. The Philippine labour regulation system is shown to have a hybrid basis, whose origins are briefly traced by identifying the legacy of the colonial and post-colonial phases, the martial law era and the restoration of democracy in 1986. Whereas Australia, another hybrid system, appears to have achieved some coherence in changes to the regulation of industrial relations, labour markets and social welfare, in the Philippines, such changes have not converged. In the 1990s, efforts to mitigate the traditional legalistic and adversarial character of industrial relations through liberalisation of restrictions on the right to organise were cross-cut by the effects of the growing labour market flexibility that resulted from integration into the global economy. Legal changes between 1999 and 2011 have not fostered voluntary self-organisation of distributive bargaining at enterprise level. Union membership, collective bargaining coverage and numbers of workers involved in notified or actual industrial action have declined, while reliance on compulsory arbitration and monetary compensation claims has remained high. Labour productivity has not improved. Within the context of globalisation, the labour market is increasingly characterised by numerical flexibility and a prevalence of small enterprises.

Or is the current crisis, a crisis of collapse of manufacturing and wages and under-consumption due to the loss of redistributive power by key socio-political agents, possibly the final crisis of unionism, as argued by Wolfgang Streeck? Some on the political left, such as Streeck, argue that a new phase has been reached where redistributive and oppositional power of organised labour has been not just defeated but destroyed, with enormous consequences for the future of workers and capitalism itself. This article rejects such an overly pessimistic interpretation and asks what the possibility is of the labour movement's again playing its historic role of transforming capitalism. It explores the potential role of organised labour in re-embedding the economy within democratic society, as Karl Polanyi argued, and building a socio-economic structure that is both stable and enhancing of social and environmental health. This problem is approached through a critique of the theories of Polanyi and Streeck and an examination of the unfortunate embrace of labourism and accommodation to neo-liberalism in the Australian labour movement. © University of New South Wales.","Counter-hegemony; labourism; neo-liberalism; organised labour; Polanyi; social democracy; Streeck","","Ayres T., Death tax grants would give young Australians a future', union secretary says, Sydney Morning Herald, (2017); Barnes A., Balnave N., Back to grass roots: Peak union councils and community campaigning, Economic and Labour Relations Review, 26, 4, pp. 577-595, (2015); Bernaciak M., Gumbrell-McCormick R., Hyman R., European Trade Unionism: From Crisis to Renewal?, (2014); Bieler A., Workers of the world, unite?

Drawing on interview data with 30 participants from research conducted in 2011-2012, this article examines young people's experiences of employment in the Illawarra region of New South Wales, Australia. Levels of unemployment and under-employment above the national average reflect two decades of globalised restructuring of the steel, coal and manufacturing industries which, together with agriculture, have historically been the region's economic base. The growth of service and knowledge industries has been accompanied by new, 'atypical' or insecure work patterns. The interview data indicate that young people's diverse experiences of transition and choice in leaving school, commencing training or further education, and entering the labour market are accompanied by a range of understandings of employment and precarious work. These experiences highlight the difficulties, divisions and contradictions in a changing regional labour market and suggest how the ideologies and practices of neo-liberalism shape and are embedded in regional labour markets and precarious work more generally. © The Author(s) 2013.","Employment; Illawarra region; neo-liberalism; precarious work; unemployment; young people; z13","","Labour Force, Australia, (2009); Forms of Employment, Australia, (2011); Labour Force, Australia, (2012); (2012); Beer A., Clower T., Haughton G., Neo-liberalism and the institutions for regional development in Australia, Geographical Research, 43, 1, pp. 49-58, (2005); Burrows S., Contesting the social impacts of neo-liberalism: Economic recovery, unemployment and young people in the Illawarra region, The Aftermath of the Crisis: Incorporating the 12th Path to Full Employment Conference and the 17th National Conference on Unemployment; Burrows S., Youth unemployment in the Illawarra Region, Journal of Australian Political Economy, 65, pp. 89-106, (2010); Burrows S., Unemployment in the Illawarra region: Understanding its historical trajectory and legacy, Illawarra Unity: Journal of the Illawarra Branch of the Australian Society for the Study of Labour History, 11, 1, pp. 51-66, (2011); Carney T., Ramia G., From Rights to Management: Contract, New Public Management and Employment Services, (2002); Cheshire L., Lawrence G., Neo-liberalism, individualisation and community: Regional restructuring in Australia, Social Identities, 11, 5, pp. 435-445, (2005); Considine M., Enterprising States: The Public Management of Welfare to Work, (2001); Cook B., Mitchell W., Quirk V., Creating Effective Local Labour Markets: A New Framework for Regional Employment Policy, (2008); Small Area Labour Markets, (2012); Eardley T., Working but poor?

It begins with the author's personal work reminiscences as a touchstone for reflecting on continuity and change in women's working lives. A first job in sheep-shearing sheds illustrates the insecurity and hard physical and emotional labour associated with manual work. Despite strides in Australian women's qualification levels, discrimination is being 'refreshed and remade'. Examples include recent Australian reversals in paid parental leave policy and the role of sexual harassment in patrolling work boundaries. The institutional basis of unequal pay and inflexible work/family time allocation is demonstrated in the Productivity Commission's 2015 Workplace Relations agenda. This recommends reduced Sunday penalty rates that will disproportionately affect feminised, low-paid retail and hospitality work and rejects any strengthening of parents' statutory right to request flexible work arrangements. Three remedies are proposed-creative approaches to research, campaigning and political action. © University of New South Wales.","Gender pay gap; paid parental leave; penalty rates; Productivity Commission; sexual harassment; work-life collision","","Smart Australians: Education and Innovation in Australia, (2012); ANZ Women's Report Barriers to Achieving Financial Gender Equity, (2015); General Social Survey: Summary Results, Australia 2014, (2015); Labour Force, Australia, Detailed, Quarterly, Feb 2015, (2015); Working Without Fear: Results of the Sexual Harassment National Telephone Survey 2012: Community Guide, (2012); Corsetti A., Women working more than ever before but paid 18.8pc less than men, ANZ discussion paper finds, ABC News, (2015); Daly T., Evenings, Nights and Weekends: Working Unsocial Hours and Penalty Rates, (2014); (2009); Decision.

After reviewing existing roadmaps for low-carbon growth by 2050, the article identifies the importance for Australia of an integrated and mutually reinforcing set of measures, based on a bold approach to urban and regional planning. Taking account of national geography, the approach is based on the decentralisation of energy production, use and storage, and on new uses of communication, transport and the location of food, water and mineral resources. Revitalised regional centres could be connected, through new energy and transport solutions, by a national transport arc and electrified highways. The use of infrastructure funding to support low-carbon regional development would avoid the 'tragedy of the commons', transcending incremental, cumulative approaches based on compensation and incentives for household, business and sectoral abatement efforts. It would generate long-term environmentally sustainable development. © University of New South Wales.","Carbon emission reduction; carbon neutrality; clean energy production and storage; climate change; global warming; greenhouse gas reduction; infrastructure funding; low-carbon growth; regional development; water resources","","Land Use Australia, Version 4, (2005); (2016); Environment and Climate Change - Final Policy (ACTU Congress), (2015); Australian Government Response to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee Report: Australia's Transport Energy Resilience and Sustainability, (2016); Australian Gas Resource Assessment 2012, (2012); Paris Agreement, (2017); Review of Australia's Climate Change Policies, (2017); Australian Energy Resources Assessment (AERA); Mapping Photovoltaic Installations, Funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, (2016); Solar Map, Funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, (2016); Beyond Zero Emissions: Ten-year Pathways to A Zero-carbon Australia, (2016); Electric vehicles, Beyond Zero Emissions, (2016); Submission to Joint Standing Committee on Treaties: Paris Agreement, (2016); Canada's Mid-century Long-term Low-greenhouse Gas Development Strategy, (2016); Pathways to Deep Decarbonisation in 2050: How Australia Can Prosper in A Low Carbon World, (2014); The CLARA Plan, (2016); Forcey T., McConnell D., Pumped hydro - The forgotten storage solution, Renew Economy, (2014); French National Low-carbon Strategy (SNBC), (2016); German Climate Action Plan 2050; Executive Summary, (2016); Renewable Energy, (2017); National Energy Security Assessment (NESA) Identified Issues: Competitive Pressures on Domestic Refining, (2012); Energy Technology Perspectives, (2016); McGrail S., A Review of Roadmaps for Transitioning to A Zero Carbon Built Environment in Australia.

Because of career histories in lower paid and more insecure employment, a higher percentage of women than men are dependent on the age pension rather than on superannuation or savings and investments, and so will be disproportionately affected by deferred access. Yet, fewer women than men hold the types of 'good jobs' that will sustain them into an older age. Women are more likely to be sequestered in precarious employment, with reduced job quality and a greater potential for premature workforce exit. This article counterposes macro-level data drawn from national cross-sectional labour force statistics and the longitudinal Household Income and Labour Dynamics Australia survey, with case study analysis, based on interviews with 38 women in midlife insecure jobs, in order to identify the types of life course and labour market barriers that contribute to women's reliance on the pension and the systemic disadvantage that will render them particularly vulnerable to any further erosion of this safety net. The analysis moves between this empirical evidence and a discussion, drawing on the theoretical literature, of the failure in equal opportunity endeavours over recent decades and what this means for later life workforce participation for women.

It marked the beginning of what might be termed the 'organising turn', a shift across the international trade union movement towards the greater prioritisation of union organising. This article reviews the 20-year experience of the turn, reflecting upon three of its core attributes. The first is the origin of much activity at the apex of the official trade union movement and the consequences that flow from this point of origin. The second is the emphasis on diversity, with a particular priority in recent times in trying to organise low-wage migrant workers in precarious employment. The final attribute can be labelled 'neo-syndicalism'. This term refers to a switch towards the 'internal' renewal of trade unions and in this regard can be counterposed to attempts at revitalisation that focus on rebuilding relations with government and employers. The article concludes by arguing that organising can and must remain central to union strategy for renewal in Australia and beyond. © The Author(s) 2015.","Collective bargaining; community organising; low-paid workers; partnership unionism; social movement unionism; syndicalism; trade unions; union renewal; union revitalisation","","Ackers P., Johnstone S., Ackers P., Trade unions as professional associations, Finding A Voice at Work?

In developing the concept of precarious work-societies, it argues that precarity is a source of individual and social vulnerability and distress, affecting family, housing and communal security. The concept of depoliticisation is used to describe the processes of displacement, whereby the social consequences of precarious work come to be seen as beyond the reach of agency. Using evidence from social attitudes surveys, we explore links between the resulting sense of political marginalisation and hostility to immigrants.

Social spending has increased based on a highly redistributive model while inequality has grown. This article explores the relationship between Australia's experience of economic restructuring and the political dynamics of an emerging 'dual welfare state'. Importantly, the article argues that Australian reformers did not reject the state per se, nor egalitarianism as an objective. Instead, reform sought to combine greater competition with compensation, generating larger inequalities in market incomes alongside growing social spending. The article explores how Labor combined neoclassical ideas about competition with a commitment to a 'small state' version of social democracy. This did moderate inequalities through the period of restructuring, but it also altered the dynamics of political contestation. The article provides two typologies to understand this political dynamic, arguing forms of marketisation opened the door to a political contest over the nature, rather than the extent, of public provision, while the model of targeting reinforced paternalist tendencies inherent in neoliberal reform. © The Author(s) 2014.","Income distribution; Markets and marketisation; Means testing; Neoliberalism; Social policy; Welfare state","","Alexander D., Free and fair - How Australia's low-tax egalitarianism confounds the world, Policy, 26, 4, pp. 3-14, (2010); Altman J., Hinkson M., Coercive Reconciliation: Stabilise, Normalise, Exit Aboriginal Australia, (2007); Annual Superannuation Bulletin, (2012); Barr N., Fundamentals of social security analysis, Australian Social Policy, 1, pp. 7-29, (1999); Barr N., The Welfare State As Piggy Bank: Information, Risk, Uncertainty and the Role of the State, (2001); Boxall A., Gillespie J., Making Medicare: The Politics of Universal Healthcare in Australia, (2013); Brennan D., The Politics of Australian Child Care: Philanthropy to Feminism and beyond, (1998); Bryson L., Verity F., Australia: From wage-earners to neo-liberal welfare state, International Social Policy: Welfare Regimes in the Developed World, pp. 66-87, (2009); Castles F.G., The Working Class and Welfare: Reflections on the Political Development of the Welfare State in Australia and New Zealand, 1890-1980, (1985); Castles F.G., The wage earners' welfare state revisited: Refurbishing the established model of Australian social protection, Australian Journal of Social Issues, 29, 2, pp. 120-145, (1994); Castles F.G., A Farewell to Australia's Welfare State, (2001); Castles F.G., Shirley I.F., Labour and social policy: Gravediggers or refurbishers of the welfare state, The Great Experiment: Labour Parties and Public Policy Transformation in Australia and New Zealand, pp. 88-106, (1996); Castles F.G., Gerritsen R., Vowles J., The Great Experiment: Labour Parties and Public Policy Transformation in Australia and New Zealand, (1996); Chapman B., Ryan C., The access implications of income-contingent charges for higher education: Lessons from Australia, Economics of Education Review, 24, 5, pp. 491-512, (2005); Considine M., Enterprising States: The Public Management of Welfare-to-Work, (2001); Cox E., The case of income management, Journal of Indigenous Policy, (2011); Davidson B., For profit organisations in managed markets for human services, Paid Care in Australia: Profits, Purpose and Practices, pp. 43-79, (2009); Deeble J.S., Financing health care in a static economy, Social Science and Medicine, 16, 6, pp. 713-724, (1982); Esping-Andersen G., The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism, (1990); Fenna A., Tapper A., The Australian welfare state and the neoliberalism thesis, Australian Journal of Political Science, 47, 2, pp. 155-172, (2012); Garnaut R., The Climate Change Review, (2008); Giddens A., The Third Way: The Renewal of Social Democracy, (1998); Gillespie J., The Price of Health: Australian Governments and Medical Politics 1910-1960, (1991); Groenewegen P., McFarlane B., A History of Australian Economic Thought, (1990); Hacker J., The Great Risk Shift: The Assault on American Jobs, Families, Health Care and Retirement, (2006); Hacker J., Pierson P., Winner-take-all politics: Public policy, political organization, and the precipitous rise of top incomes in the United States, Politics & Society, 38, 2, pp. 152-204, (2010); Harding A., The suffering middle: Trends in income inequality in Australia, 1982 to 1993-4, Australian Economic Review, 30, 4, pp. 341-358, (1997); Harvey D., A Brief History of Neoliberalism, (2005); Hills J., Following or leading public opinion?

Even less is known about Indigenous businesses. Supply Nation defines an Indigenous business as those where Indigenous stakeholders hold majority equity, but some researchers have argued that this definition could be relaxed to include businesses in which Indigenous people hold only half the equity in the enterprise. This article uses data from the Industry Capability Network Queensland, which has collected basic business information on a large number of businesses operating in Queensland. The findings reveal that Indigenous businesses have substantially better outcomes for Indigenous employment than non-Indigenous businesses - a result that holds even when the definition of Indigenous business is relaxed. The article also documents how Indigenous employment is concentrated in larger businesses, in particular industry sectors. Non-Indigenous micro-businesses employ relatively few Indigenous workers, and future research can usefully explore why this is the case. To understand the issues involved, it will be necessary to collect multi-level data that link detailed information on employers and employees (including a substantial sample of Indigenous workers). © The Author(s) 2015.","Business and Indigenous employment; entrepreneurs; Indigenous-friendly workplaces","","Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification (ANZSIC), 2006, (2008); Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS): Volume 2 - Indigenous Structure, (2011); Biddle N., Population and Age Structure.

Yet union networks, particularly networks of delegates, and ways to build them, are still poorly understood. This is a study of the meaning that workplace union delegates assign to networks of support. It explores the characteristics of effective delegate and union networks and influences upon them. Effective networks are a combination of strong and weak ties, such that delegates sometimes do not recognise they are part of a network. Our three-stage research methodology involved delegate focus groups, a paper-based self-completion questionnaire of recently trained delegates (N = 473) and a follow-up telephone survey (N = 145). It found that organisers were key to creation of internal workplace networks (although they did not necessarily establish them) and in providing a bridge for delegates with external networks. They were the key support person for many delegates. Networks took a variety of forms. Only a minority were formalised. A majority were mainly internal to the workplace. Social media were rarely used, with little intention of using them more, and were, we suspect, underutilised. © The Author(s) 2015.","Informal networks; network-building; networks; social capital; social media; trade unions; union delegates; union networks; union organisers; weak ties; workplace relations","","Aalto-Matturi S., The Internet: The new workers' hall.

In responding to labour market changes, declining union membership and hostile governments and employers, peak union bodies have developed new ways to strengthen the collective ability of their affiliated unions to successfully represent members at the workplace level. They have embraced local-level strategies that tap into community concerns and are aimed at capacity building across the labour movement. The resulting grass-roots organisations have the potential to shape both the workplace and the public domain. We explore one example of this approach: the establishment of Local Union Community Councils by Unions NSW. We argue that although peak bodies are well placed to spearhead community campaigning, the grass-roots councils being created will need to progress through several stages of development, if they are to become self-sustaining organisations, contributing effectively over the long term to community mobilisation and stronger, more coordinated union campaigns. © The Author(s) 2015.","Community organising; grass roots; labour organisation; peak union councils; trade union campaigns; union revitalisation; worker mobilisation","","Barnes A., Trade unionism in 2005, Journal of Industrial Relations, 48, 3, pp. 369-383, (2006); Barnes A., Australian unions in 2006, Journal of Industrial Relations, 49, 3, pp. 380-393, (2007); Brigden C., Baird M., Cooper R., Westcott M., Exploring Gender in Peak Union Bodies, 1, pp. 67-76, (2005); Brigden C., Kaine S., Rethinking factional alliances and union renewal: Inter-union collaboration in the 21st century, Economic and Industrial Democracy, 36, 2, pp. 239-257, (2013); Burgmann M., Burgmann V., Green Bans Movement, Dictionary of Sydney, (2011); Cooper R., Peak council organising at work: ACTU strategy 1994-2000, Labour and Industry, 14, 1, pp. 1-15, (2003); Cranford C.J., Ladd D., Community unionism: Organising for fair employment in Canada, Just Labour, 3, 2, pp. 46-59, (2003); Doughty P., Rights at work: A page turner, The Hummer, 5, 1, pp. 10-15, (2009); Ellem B., Peak union campaigning: Fighting for rights at work in Australia, British Journal of Industrial Relations, 51, 2, pp. 264-287, (2013); Ellem B., Shields J., Why do unions form peak bodies? the case of the Barrier Industrial Council, The Journal of Industrial Relations, 38, 3, pp. 377-411, (1996); Ellem B., Shields J., Ellem B., Markey R., Shields J., The Barrier Industrial Council: A study in local peak union origins, purpose, power and decline, Peak Unions in Australia: Origins, Purpose, Power, Agency, pp. 133-151, (2004); Frege C., Heery E., Kelly J., Comparative Coalition Building and the Revitalization of the Labor Movement, pp. 122-130, (2003); Hagan J., The History of the ACTU, (1981); Heery E., Williams S., Abbott B., Civil society organizations and trade unions: Cooperation, conflict, indifference, Work, Employment and Society, 26, 1, pp. 145-160, (2012); Holgate J., An international study of trade union involvement in community organizing: Same model, different outcomes, British Journal of Industrial Relations, 53, 3, pp. 460-483, (2015); Holgate J., Community organising in the UK: A 'new' approach for trade unions?, Economic and Industrial Democracy, 36, 3, pp. 431-455, (2015); Jerrard M., Cockfield S., Buttigieg D., Gall G., The 'servicing-organising-community continuum': Where are Australian unions today?, The Future of Union Organising: Building for Tomorrow, pp. 97-113, (2009); Markey R., In Case of Oppression: The Life and Times of the Labor Council of NSW, (1994); Martinez Lucio M., Perrett R., Meanings and dilemmas in community unionism: Trade union community initiatives and black and minority ethnic groups in the UK, Work, Employment and Society, 23, 4, pp. 693-710, (2009); Martinez Lucio M., Stuart M., Gall G., Organising and union modernisation: Narratives of renewal in Britain, Union Revitalisation in Advanced Economies: Assessing the Contribution of Unions Organising, pp. 17-37, (2009); Milkman R., Milkman R., Bloom J., Narro V., Introduction, Working for Justice: The L.A.

This article uses Markov chain analysis to study the labour market transitions of South Korean women in different age groups. It shows the importance of differentiating the effects of contemporary labour market conditions, shaped by the forces of the moment, from conditions created by the institutional legacy of the past. Women's traditional position in the labour market has resulted in age-linked gendered precariousness, while the conditions of the moment are generating a tendency towards less precarious employment. Transition matrices are developed for types of precarious employment defined by the combination of job stability and job quality, taking into account duration by age group, time period, and covariates. These matrices yield distributions of asymptotic prevalence, reflecting labour market conditions of the moment. The forces of the moment favour the predominance of stable good-quality employment, whereas observed prevalence at a given date is characterised by the polarisation of the labour market between stable good-quality and unstable bad-quality employment. Asymptotic prevalence reveals a steady increase in stable but bad-quality employment. Older women are observed mostly in unstable bad-quality employment, but labour market conditions are tending to attenuate this age cleavage over time, as the conditions of the moment are reducing the proportions of older women in stable bad-quality and unstable good-quality employment. The conclusion is an age-based polarisation, in which older women are faring badly, but where possibilities are now opening up to younger South Korean women, reflected in the sharp break between the situation inherited from the past and the conditions of the moment. But possibilities for younger women will be realised only through a reinforcement of government policies to support career breaks and work-family balance through decent part-time jobs.

The sale of government-owned electricity companies has contributed to that liberalisation and a quarter of the proceeds of one of the world's largest privatisation programmes. In 2014, the state governments of New South Wales and Queensland announced further electricity privatisations if re-elected. Advocates claim private ownership will mean more productive investment, lower costs leading to more efficient operations, lower prices for all consumers and better market functioning without government interference. Opponents contend that the true value of government businesses is not being realised at sale, retention can achieve returns greater than those from a sale, and that follow sale, prices will rise and jobs will be lost. This article demonstrates that the claims of either lower or higher prices, of job losses and of more efficient operations are tantamount to being myths of privatisation not borne out by reality. © The Author(s) 2015.","Australia; electricity; privatisation","","Abbott M., Cohen B., A survey of the privatisation of government-owned enterprises in Australia since the 1980s, Australian Economic Review, 47, 4, pp. 432-454, (2014); Aulich C., O'Flynn J., From public to private: The Australian experience of privatisation, Asia Pacific Journal of Public Administration, 29, 2, pp. 153-171, (2007); Census of Population and Housing: Working Population Profile, (2006); Census of Population and Housing: Working Population Profile, (2011); Australian System of National Accounts, 2012-13, (2013); Estimates of Industry Multifactor Productivity, 2012-13, (2013); Consumer Price Index, Australia, (2014); Labour Force, Australia, Detailed, Quarterly, (2014); ACTEW/AGL Partnership Facilitation Bill 2000.

Using two small case studies undertaken in Singapore as a starting point, this article reflects on the moral economies of supply chain capitalism. Detailing examples of the human impacts of down-sourcing risk through 'flexible' modes of transnational employment, it analyses the strategies whereby firms and governments distance themselves from these consequences. Precarious forms of employment based on pyramid subcontracting arrangements allow a disruption of the moral relation (however tenuous) that is present in traditional face-to-face employment arrangements. The article explores four strategies of moral detachment on the part of the employers, contractors and brokers in the supply chain. © The Author(s) 2013.","Foreign workers Singapore; globalisation; human rights; Indian foreign workers low-paid workers; J61; migrant labour; migration; neo-liberalism; precarious work; racism; supply chain; vulnerable workers","","Afsar R., Unravelling the Vicious Cycle of Recruitment: Labour Migration from Bangladesh to the Gulf States, (2009); Agamben G., Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life, (1998); Allamby L., Bell J., Hamilton J., Forced Labour in Northern Ireland: Exploiting Vulnerability, (2011); Apostleship of the Sea, (2010); Barrientos S., Contract labour: The 'Achilles heel' of corporate codes in commercial value chains, Development and Change, 39, 6, pp. 977-990, (2008); Flag State Management, (2008); Brennan M., Out of Sight, out of Mind.

A brief narrative of the evolution of the European Monetary Union yields some insights into its peculiar institutional design. More specifically, the article examines the dangerously self-reinforcing logic between speculative bond markets and cascading, deflationary policies of austerity imposed on those countries encountering severe debt crises. This examination reveals the fragile foundations upon which the eurozone was constructed. © The Author(s) 2014.","Capital; crisis; debt; euro; eurozone; monetary; money","","Arestis P., Sawyer M., The problems of the economic and monetary union: Is there any escape?, Journal of Economic Analysis, 1, 1, pp. 1-14, (2010); Bellofiore I., Garibaldo F., Halevi J., The Crisis This Time, pp. 120-146, (2010); Bibow J., The Euro Debt Crisis and Germany's Euro Trilemma, (2012); Bouvet F., EMU and the dynamics of regional per capita income inequality in Europe, Journal of Economic Inequality, 8, 3, pp. 323-344, (2010); Cecchini P., 1992: The European Challenge, (1988); Cesaratto S., Controversial and Novel Features of the Eurozone Crisis As A Balance of Payments Crisis, (2012); Cohen B.J., The Future of the Global Economy: The Euro Versus the Dollar, (2011); Cohen B.J., The future of the euro: Let's get real, Review of International Political Economy, 19, 4, pp. 689-700, (2012); Commission of the European Communities, Completing the Internal Market, (1985); Delors J., Report on economic and monetary union in the European community, Committee for the Study of Economic and Monetary Union, (1989); Dyson K., The Euro at 10: Europeanization, Power and Convergence, (2008); Eichengreen B., Exorbitant Privilege, (2011); Erickson C.L., Kuruvilla S., Labor costs and the social dumping debate in the European Union, Industrial & Labor Relations Review, 48, 1, pp. 28-47, (1994); Phase 2: The European Monetary System.

Coupled with membership decline and internal restructuring through union amalgamations, they prompted an important reorientation by unions (back) to the workplace, and precipitated different strategic decisions and organising challenges. However, the proliferation of fragmented employment relationships rendered workplace-centred organising an insufficient response. As a result, some unions experimented with ways of supplementing existing legal frameworks by other regulatory initiatives, through campaigns that resulted in the layering of regulation. In this article, we examine attempts by three unions - covering garment workers, road transport workers and aged care workers - to address the needs of members in garment homeworking, road transport and aged care in a contested regulatory environment. © The Author(s) 2015.","Employment regulation; informal regulation; institutional layering; labour law; regulatory layering; regulatory pluralism; reinforcing labour regulation; supply chain labour standards; trade union strategy; union campaigning","","Aged Care Industry Award MA 000018, (2010); Barnes A., Australian unions in 2006, Journal of Industrial Relations, 49, 3, pp. 380-393, (2007); Beland D., Ideas and institutional change in social security: Conversion, layering and policy drift, Social Science Quarterly, 88, 1, pp. 20-38, (2007); Bray M., Waring P., Complexity' and 'congruence' in Australian labour regulation, Journal of Industrial Relations, 47, 1, pp. 1-15, (2005); Brigden C., Kaine S., Rethinking factional alliances and union renewal: Inter-union collaboration in the 21st century, Economic and Industrial Democracy, 36, 2, pp. 239-257, (2015); Burchielli R., Delaney A., Coventry K., Campaign strategies to develop regulatory mechanisms: Protecting Australian garment homeworkers, Journal of Industrial Relations, 56, 1, pp. 81-102, (2014); Carter B., Cooper R., The organizing model and the management of change: A comparative study of unions in Australia and Britain, Relations Industrielles/Industrial Relations, 57, 4, pp. 712-742, (2002); Charlesworth S., MacDonald F., Women, work and industrial relations in Australia in 2013, Journal of Industrial Relations, 56, 3, pp. 381-396, (2014); Cooper R., Getting organised?

It argues that sexual harassment is fostered both by coercive labour conditions within global value chains and by existing hierarchical gender relations. The research finds that harassment is widespread, that many lack a vocabulary to describe or discuss this, and that female casual and temporary workers are most likely to be targeted. Action research coupled with organisation of workers, however, has been effective in giving voice to those suffering harassment: this is a first step in a feminist labour mobilisation and policy formulation. Procedures against sexual harassment are beginning to be formulated: a key concern is implementation. Addressing sexual harassment is central in ensuring the security of working people, particularly the most marginalised. © © The Author(s) 2015.","Decent work; gender; global value networks; labour rights; occupational safety; sexual harassment; trade unions; vulnerable workers","","Barrientos S.W., Gender and Global Value Chains: Challenges of Economic and Social Upgrading in Agri-food, (2014); Berdhal J., Harassment based on Sex: Protecting social status in the context of gender hierarchy, Academy of Management Review, 32, 2, pp. 641-858, (2007); Brahic B., Jacobs S., Empowering women: A labour rights-based approach, Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics, 26, 3, pp. 601-619, (2013); Brahic B., Olaiya M.M., Jacobs S., English R., Organising women in the agribusiness sector: Case studies from East Africa, Labour, Capital and Society, 44, 1, pp. 70-97, (2011); Briskin L., Colgan F., Ledwith S., The equality project in Canadian trade unions: Confronting the challenge of restructuring and globalisation, Gender and Diversity in Trade Unions, pp. 28-47, (2002); Christian M., Evers B., Barrientos S.W., Women in Value Chains: Making A Difference, (2013); Cockburn C., In the Way of Women, (1991); Connell R., Gender: In World Perspective, (2009); Dejardin A.K., Gender Dimensions of Globalization, (2008); Dominguez M., Sex discrimination and sexual harassment in agricultural labor, American University Journal of Gender and Law, 231, pp. 231-259, (1998); Doss C., Intrahousehold Bargaining and Resource Allocation in Developing Countries, (2011); Elson D., Pearson R., Nimble fingers make cheap workers: An analysis of womens employment in third world export manufacturing, Feminist Review, 7, pp. 87-107, (1981); Sexual Harassment in the Workplace in the European Union, (1999); Fitzgerald L., Shullman S., Bailey N., The incidence and dimensions of sexual harassment in academia and the workplace, Journal of Vocational Behaviour, 32, 2, pp. 152-175, (1988); Friedmann H., Patriarchal commodity production, Social Analysis, 20, pp. 47-55, (1986); Sexual Harassment and Gender-based Violence in the Public Sector Workplace in Tanzania Mainland, (2014); Best Practices for Combating Sexual Harassment at the Workplace in the Horticulture Industry in the East African Region, (2013); Gruber J., Methodological problems and policy implications in sexual harassment research, Population Research and Policy Review, 9, 3, pp. 235-254, (1990); Hale A., Sweetman C., The Deregulated Global Economy: Women Workers and Strategies of Resistance, Women, Employment and Exclusion, pp. 8-15, (1996); Hewamanne S., Stitching Identities in A Free Trade Zone: Gender and Politics in Sri Lanka, (2008); Violence Against Women in the Workplace in Kenya, (2002); Spreading the Message on Sexual Harassment in Jordans Garment Factories, (2013); Sexual Harassment at Work: Factsheet, (2014); Stopping Sexual Harassment at Work: A Trade Union Guide, (2008); Asia-Pacific Report to ITUC 3rd Congress, (2014); Jacobs S., Gender and Agrarian Reforms, (2010); Kelly L., Surviving Sexual Violence, (1988); Kirton G., The Making of Women Trade Unionists, (2007); Labuschane L., Flower farming: Kenyan horticulture leads the way, Pesticides, 82, 2, pp. 6-7, (2008); Ledwith S., Colgan F., Colgan F., Ledwith S., Tackling gender, diversity and trade union democracy, Gender and Diversity in Trade Unions, pp. 1-27, (2002); Lonsway K., Cortina L., Magley V., Sexual harassment mythology: Definition, conceptualization and measurement, Sex Roles, 58, 9-10, pp. 599-615, (2008); McCann D., Sexual Harassment at Work: National and International Responses, (2005); McDonald P., Workplace sexual harassment 30 years on: A review of the literature, International Journal of Management Reviews, 14, 1, pp. 1-17, (2012); MacKinnon C., Sexual Harassment of Working Women, (1979); Mariam A., Speaking truth on behalf of Ethiopian women, Huffington Post, (2011); Marix Evans L., Jack M., Programme Evaluation Report for WWW, (2011); Maypole D., Sexual harassment at work: A review of research and theory, Affilia, 2, 1, pp. 4-38, (1987); Maypole D., Skaine R., Sexual harassment of blue collar workers, Journal of Sociology and Social Welfare, 9, 4, pp. 682-695, (1982); MyWage K., Sexual Harassment: What Does the Law Say?, (2014); OLeary-Kelly A., Bowes-Sperry L., Bates A., Sexual harassment at work: A decade (plus) of progress, Journal of Management, 35, 3, pp. 503-536, (2009); Pantaleon L., Sexual Harassment in the Export Processing Zones of the Dominican Republic, (2003); Parker J., Foley J., Progress on womens equality within UK and Canadian trade unions: Do womens structures make a difference?, Industrial Relations, 65, 2, pp. 281-301, (2010); Pearson R., Cornwall A., Harrison C., Whitehead A., Reassessing paid work and womens empowerment, Feminisms in Development, pp. 201-213, (2007); Rogers J.K., Henson K., Hey, why dont you wear a shorter skirt?

The level of demand for child labour is shown to be linked mainly to adult wage levels, the adult unemployment rate in an area, and the size of the informal and agriculture sectors. The supply of child labour is seen to be positively linked to the proportion of adult unemployment in the household. Unlike previous studies, the article analyses both demand and supply side factors in a context of poverty and takes account of the co-existence of formal and informal labour markets. Furthermore, to generalise the issue for a longer span of time (which previous studies fail to do), it adopts the methodology of a pseudo-panel approach based on that proposed by Deaton. This approach makes it possible to pinpoint more accurately the factors, and their interaction, that need to be considered in any effective policy approach to the issue of child labour. To prevent unintended consequences, a multi-faceted development approach is required. © University of New South Wales.","Child labour; informal sector; pseudo-panel data analysis; unemployment rate; wage levels","","Ali K., Khan R.E.A., Simultaneous decision making of child schooling and child labour in Pakistani urban households, The Lahore Journal of Economics, 9, 1, pp. 127-148, (2004); Basu K., Van P.H., The economics of child labour, The American Economic Review, 88, 3, pp. 412-427, (1998); Bhalotra S., Parent Altruism, Cash Transfers and Child Poverty, (2004); Bhalotra S., Is child work necessary, Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics, 69, 1, pp. 29-55, (2007); Bhalotra S., Heady C., Child farm labour: The wealth paradox, World Bank Economic Review, 17, 2, pp. 197-227, (2003); Burki A.A., Urban informal sector in Pakistan: Some selected issues, The Pakistan Development Review, 28, 4, pp. 911-924, (1989); Cain M., Mozumder A., Labour Market Structure, Child Employment, and Reproductive Behaviour in Rural South Asia, (1980); Chaudhuri S., Labour Market Reform and Incidence of Child Labour in A Developing Economy, (2009); Deaton A., Panel data from time series of cross-sections, Journal of Econometrics, 30, 1-2, pp. 109-126, (1985); Dwibedi J.K., Chaudhuri S., Foreign capital, return to education and child labour, International Review of Economics & Finance, 19, 2, pp. 278-286, (2010); Galli R., The Economic Impact of Child Labour, (2001); Ghayur S., Labour market issues in Pakistan: Unemployment, working conditions, and child labour, The Pakistan Development Review, 35, 4, pp. 789-803, (1996); Hai A.A., Fatima A., Sadaqat M., A case study for the fishing sector on Balochistan coast, International Journal of Social Economics, 37, 4, pp. 316-338, (2010); Hazarika G., Bedi A.S., Schooling cost and Child Work in Rural Pakistan, The Journal of Development Studies, 39, 5, pp. 29-64, (2003); Hou X., Wealth: Crucial but Not Sufficient Evidence from Pakistan on Economic Growth, Child Labour and Schooling, (2009); Hussain A., Child workers in hazardous industries in Pakistan, The Lahore Journal of Economics, 2, 2, pp. 59-79, (1998); Hussmanns R., Statistical definition of informal employment: Guidelines endorsed, Proceedings of the Seventeenth International Conference of Labour Statisticians, (2003); Towards An Internationally Accepted Statistical Definition of Child Labour: Children's Activities and Their Definitions, (2007); Iram U., Fatima A., International trade, foreign direct investment and the phenomenon of child labour: The case of Pakistan, International Journal of Social Economics, 35, 11, pp. 809-822, (2008); Kar S., Guha-Khasnobis B., Wage Determination of Child Labour and Effect of Trade Reform, (2003); Khan R.E.A., The Lahore Journal of Economics, 6, 1, pp. 93-112, (2001); Khan R.E.A., Children in different activities: Child schooling and child labour, Pakistan Development Review, 42, 2, pp. 137-160, (2003); Moazam M., Tariq J., Baig A., Why children do not go to school in Pakistan: Some estimate and a theoretical framework, The Pakistan Development Review, 33, 4, pp. 1231-1248, (1994); Moffitt R., Identification and estimation of dynamic models with a time series of repeated cross-sections, Journal of Econometrics, 59, 1-2, pp. 99-123, (1993); Summary results of child labour survey in Pakistan, Government of Pakistan, Islamabad, (1996); Labour Force Surveys, Islamabad, Pakistan, (1997); Labour Force Surveys: Concepts and Definitions, (2007); Section I: Methodology, (2008); Ranjan R., Analysis of child labour in Peru and Pakistan: A comparative study, Journal of Population Economic, 13, 1, pp. 3-19, (2000); Ranjan R., Simultaneous Analysis of Child Labour and Child Schooling: Comparative Evidence from Nepal and Pakistan, Schools of Economics, University of Tasmania, Australia, (2001); Toor I.A., Child labour's link with literacy and poverty in Pakistan, The Lahore Journal of Economics, 10, 1, pp. 15-32, (2005); Verbeek M., Nijman T., Minimum MSE estimation of a regression model with fixed effects from a series of cross-sections, Journal of Econometrics, 59, 1-2, pp. 125-136, (1993); Verbeek M., Vella F., Estimating dynamic models from repeated cross-sections, Journal of Econometrics, 127, 1, pp. 83-102, (2005)","A.

Using a whole-of-government approach and a combination of direct involvement and the creation of an enabling environment, the government appears to have contributed to vastly increased rice production and export. © University of New South Wales.","Agricultural development; Asian development state; Cambodia; economic development; market failure; post-conflict states; poverty alleviation; rice production and marketing","","Cambodia Rice Value Chain Study: Crop Year 2009-2010, (2010); Bagchi A.K., The past and the future of the developmental state, Journal of World Systems Research, 1, 2, pp. 398-442, (2000); LICADHO opens up its land concessions data, urges full transparency from the government, LICADHO, (2015); CREA Website, (2014); Collier P., The political economy of state failure, Oxford Review of Economic Policy, 25, 2, pp. 219-240, (2009); Collier P., Elliott V., Hegre H., Et al., Breaking the Conflict Trap: Civil War and Development, (2003); Diamond L., Thinking about hybrid regimes, Journal of Democracy, 13, 2, pp. 21-35, (2002); Diepart J.C., The Fragmentation of Land Tenure Systems in Cambodia: Peasants and the Formalization of Land Rights, (2015); Cambodia and the EU, European Union External Action, (2016); Country Fact Sheet on Food and Agriculture Policy Trends: Cambodia, (2014); Gottesman E., Cambodia after the Khmer Rouge: Inside the Politics of Nation Building, (2004); Helmers K., Nesbitt H., Rice in the Cambodian economy: Past and present, Rice Production in Cambodia, pp. 1-14, (1997); Hunt L., Cambodia's ruling elite may face ICC probe over land grab, The Diplomat, (2014); Transforming the rice industry and building export capacity in Cambodia, IFC, (2014); Cambodia Rice Export Potential and Strategies, (2015); Varieties of developmental states: Three non-western pathways to the millennium development goals, Journal of Developing Societies, 28, 3, pp. 355-378, (2012); Keo T., Corruption in Cambodia?, The Diplomat, 10, (2013); EU seeks other rice markets, Khmer Times, (2016); Kumar R., Research Methodology: A Step-by-Step Guide for Beginners, (2005); Le Fevre J., Cambodia fragrant rice exports to EU threatened by rogue traders, AEC News, (2016); Miles M., Huberman A., Qualitative Data Analysis: An Extended Source Book, (1994); Action Plan for Paddy Production and Rice Export Promotion, (2011); (2012); Agricultural Statistics; Strategy for Agriculture and Water: Cambodian Agricultural and Water Resources Research, Education and Extension Program, (2009); Poverty in Cambodia: A New Approach, (2013); Muyhong C., China signs 100,00-tonne rice import agreement, The Phnom Penh Post, (2014); Neuman W., Social Research Methods: Qualitative and Quantitative Approaches, (2009); Ngoun K., Rethinking Cambodia's political transformation, New Mandala, (2013); Policy Paper on the Promotion of Paddy Production and Rice Export, (2010); Annual Report 2010, (2010); Slayton T., Muniroth S., Cambodia-Rice Sector Review: Turning Cambodian Rice into White Gold, (2012); Slayton T., Muniroth S., A More Detailed Road Map for Cambodian Rice Exports, (2015); Slocomb M., The People's Republic of Kampuchea 1979-1989, (2004); Sophea K., The Rice Situation in Cambodia, (2012); Stubbs R., Whatever happened to the East Asian developmental state? the unfolding debate, Pacific Review, 22, 1, pp. 1-22, (2009); Styllis G., Million-ton rice export goal remains elusive, The Cambodian Daily, (2015); Taliercio R., From A Whole of Government to A Whole of Reform Approach?: Reforming the Cambodian Civil Service, 500; Cambodia: Corruption concerns amid hopes for the future, Transparency International, (2014); Turner M., Why is it difficult to reform some Asian bureaucracies?

The effect of collective bargaining on the two main concepts that make up wages (the contractual or basic-bargained wage, and the wage cushion) are analysed during the last period of the upward cycle (2002-2006) and the beginning of the global financial crisis (2006-2010). The wage cushion is defined as the difference between the earned wage and the basic-bargained wage. The results show that workers covered by firm bargaining experienced greater wage dispersion than workers covered by multi-employer bargaining. On the other hand, wage dispersion for all workers decreased during the analysis period, mainly during the first stage of the current economic crisis, and particularly among workers covered by multi-employer bargaining. Both the decreasing relevance of the wage cushion in actual wage formation and its reduced dispersion make it possible to explain this wage compression. © University of New South Wales.","Collective bargaining; economic crisis; Spain; wage cushion; wage dispersion","","Aidt T., Tzannatos Z., Unions and Collective Bargaining: Economic Effects in A Global Environment, (2002); Antonczyk D., Fitzenberger F., Leuschner U., Can a task-based approach explain the recent changes in the German wage structure?, Journal of Economics and Statistics, 229, 2-3, pp. 214-238, (2009); Arranz J.M., Garcia-Serrano C., How green was my valley: Earnings differentials and the changing distribution of wages in Spain, International Journal of Manpower, 35, 7, pp. 1059-1087, (2014); Bastos P., Monteiro N., Straume O.R., Firm heterogeneity and wages in unionised labour markets: Theory and evidence, Labour Economics, 16, 4, pp. 440-450, (2009); Bertola G., Blau F., Kahn L., Comparative Analysis of Labor Market Outcomes: Lessons for the US from International Long-run Evidence, (2001); Blau F., Kahn L., International differences in male wage inequality: Institutions versus market forces, Journal of Political Economy, 104, 4, pp. 791-836, (1996); Blau F., Kahn L., Institutions and laws in the labor market, Handbook of Labor Economics, 3, pp. 1399-1461, (1999); Blau F., Kahn L., At Home and Abroad: U.S. Labor-Market Performance in International Perspective, (2002); Boeri T., Two-tier Bargaining, (2014); Bonhomme S., Hospido L., The Cycle of Earnings Inequality: Evidence from Spanish Social Security Data, (2012); Calmfors L., Driffill J., Bargaining structure, corporatism and macroeconomic performance, Economic Policy, 3, 6, pp. 13-61, (1988); Canal J.F., Rodriguez C., Collective bargaining and wage dispersion in Spain, British Journal of Industrial Relations, 42, 3, pp. 481-506, (2004); Card D., De La Rica S., Firm-level contracting and the structure of wages in Spain, Industrial and Labor Relations Review, 59, 4, pp. 573-592, (2006); Cardoso A., Portugal P., Contractual wages and the wage cushion under different bargaining settings, Journal of Labor Economics, 23, 4, pp. 879-902, (2005); Casado J.M., Simon H., La evolución de la estructura salarial (2002-2010), Revista de Economía Aplicada, 22, 67, pp. 1-39, (2015); Checchi D., Pagani L., The Effects of Unions on Wage Inequality: The Italian Case in the 1990s, (2004); Dahl C., Le Maire D., Mun J., Wage Dispersion and Decentralization of Wage Bargaining, (2011); Dell'Aringa C., Lucifora C., Collective bargaining and relative earnings in Italy, European Journal of Political Economy, 10, 4, pp. 727-747, (1994); Dell'Aringa C., Pagani L., Collective bargaining and wage dispersion, British Journal of Industrial Relations, 45, 1, pp. 29-54, (2007); DiNardo J., Lemieux T., Diverging male wage inequality in the United States and Canada, 1981-1988: Do institutions explain the difference?, Industrial and Labor Relations Review, 50, 4, pp. 629-651, (1997); Driffill J., The centralization of wage bargaining revisited.

Despite this disquiet, there has been little scholarly examination of the implications of living on Newstart. In this article, through the use of a survey and in-depth interviews, we examine features of everyday life for Newstart recipients in the Sydney area, experiences that reveal the scarring potential of low benefits. The article illustrates that for a majority of interview participants, the most basic items were difficult to purchase and many of the interviewees were living in inadequate and even unsafe situations owing to an inability to afford satisfactory accommodation. For some, their lack of disposable income had severe health implications. Social isolation was a common phenomenon, and many of the interviewees found that the low payment made finding employment a lot more challenging. © The Author(s) 2014.","Deprivation; Health impacts; Housing; Newstart; Scarring; Social isolation; Social security; Unemployment","","Gillard snubs un on single parent welfare?, The Australian, (2013); $35 A Day: Not Enough to Live on, (2012); Senate References Committee Report Into: The Adequacy of the Allowance Payment System for Jobseekers and Others, the Appropriateness of the Allowance Payment System As A Support into Work and the Impact of the Changing Nature of the Labour Market, (2012); Submission (No 38) to the Senate Inquiry on the Adequacy of the Allowance Payment System for Jobseekers and Others A Joint Interagency Submission, (2012); Eligibility for Newstart Allowance, (2013); Social Distribution of Health Risks and Health Outcomes: Preliminary Analysis of the National Health Survey, 2007-08, (2012); Bambra C., Eikemo T.A., Welfare state regimes, unemployment and health: A comparative study of the relationship between unemployment and self-reported health in 23 European countries, Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, 63, pp. 92-98, (2009); Carney T., Reforming Social Security: Improving Incentives and Capabilities, (2008); Clasen J., Clegg D., Beyond activation reforming European unemployment protection systems in post-industrial labour markets, European Societies, 8, 4, pp. 527-553, (2006); Coad M., Finlay R., Raper M., Et al., Welfare to Work or Unworkable Welfare?, (2006); Davidson P., Did ""work first"" work?

To what extent, however, is the labour market absorbing and fully utilising these capabilities? Drawing on data from a recent cohort of PhD graduates, we examine the correlates and consequences of qualification and skills mismatch. We show that job characteristics such as economic sector and main work activity play a fundamental and direct role in explaining the phenomenon of mismatch, experienced as overeducation and overskilling. Academic attributes operate mostly indirectly in explaining this mismatch, since their effect loses importance once we control for job-related characteristics. We detected a significant earnings penalty for those who are both overeducated and overskilled. Being mismatched reduces satisfaction with the job as a whole and with non-monetary aspects of the job, especially for those whose skills are underutilised. Overall, the problem of mismatch among PhD graduates is closely related to the demand-side constraints of the labour market. Increasing the number of adequate jobs and broadening the job skills that PhD students acquire during training should be explored as possible responses. © University of New South Wales.","Doctors; earnings; graduate attributes; graduate employment; job satisfaction; overeducation; overskilling; skill underutilisation","","Agarwal R., Ohyama A., Industry or academia, basic or applied?

Other countries like Britain with its Research Excellence Framework also have similar metrics. While much analysis and publicity is devoted to the rankings of the quality of research, there has been very little focus on how this ranked research has then gone on to make a public policy impact. In the case of the economics discipline, there has been little exploration of the relationship between publication in a high-ranked journal and contribution to an analysis of Australia's most pressing economic issues. This article investigates the extent to which articles in the Diamond list of journals from 2001 to 2010 addressed Australian economic issues. Our results indicate that articles on current policy issues accounted for a very modest fraction of total Diamond list journal articles. One possible explanation for this finding, which is investigated further, is the correlation between an economics department's Excellence in Research Australia ranking and the number of staff who obtained their doctorates from an overseas university. Such a correlation has implications for the status afforded to economics research with a specific national focus. © University of New South Wales.","Academic economists; academic league tables; economics journal rankings; Excellence in Research Australia; research impact; research quality","","Benefits Realisation Review of Excellence on Research for Australia, (2013); Adler N.J., Harzing A.W., When knowledge wins: Transcending the sense and nonsense of academic rankings, The Academy of Management Learning and Education, 8, 1, pp. 72-79, (2009); National Innovation and Science Agenda: Researchers and Universities, (2015); Glossary of Terms for Research Impact, (2015); Excellence in Research for Australia, (2016); Bloch H., An uneven playing field: Rankings and ratings for economics in ERA 2010, Economic Papers, 31, 4, pp. 418-427, (2012); Coleman W., A young tree dead? the story of economics in Australia and New Zealand, Routledge Handbook of the History of Global Economic Thought, pp. 281-293, (2015); Das J., Do Q., Shaines K., Et al., US and them: The geography of academic research, Journal of Development Economics, 105, pp. 112-130, (2013); Davidson S., Excellence in research for Australia: An audit of the applied economics rankings, Agenda, 20, 2, pp. 5-20, (2013); Diamond A., The core journals of economics, Current Contents, 21, 1, pp. 4-11, (1989); Annual Report, (2010); Annual Report, (2012); Groenewegen P., McFarlane B., A History of Australian Economic Thought, (1990); Hussain S., Journal list fetishism and the 'sign of 4' in the ABS guide: A question of trust?, Organization, 22, 1, pp. 119-138, (2015); Johnston J., Reeves A., Talbot S., Has economics become an elite subject for elite UK universities?, Oxford Review of Education, 40, 5, pp. 590-609, (2014); Lodewijks J., Stokes T., Is academic economics withering in Australia?, Agenda, 21, 1, pp. 69-88, (2014); Marginson S., The knowledge economy and higher education: Rankings and classifications, research metrics and learning outcomes measures as a system for regulating the value of knowledge, Higher Education Management and Policy, 21, 1, pp. 1-15, (2009); Millmow A., The changing sociology of the Australian academic economics profession, Economic Papers, 29, 1, pp. 87-95, (2010); Nedeva M., Boden R., Nugroho Y., Rank and file: Managing individual performance in university research, Higher Education Policy, 25, 3, pp. 335-360, (2012); Neri F., Rodgers J., The contribution of Australian academia to the world's best economics research: 2001 to 2010, Economic Record, 91, 292, pp. 107-124, (2015); Rafols I., Leydesdorff L., O'Hare A., Et al., How journal rankings can suppress interdisciplinary research: A comparison between innovation studies and business and management, Research Policy, 41, 7, pp. 1262-1282, (2011); Stern L.N., Building on Success and Learning from Experience: An Independent Review of the Research Excellence Framework, July, (2016); UNSW Goes Global to Recruit 600 of the Best Research Minds, 4 March, (2016); Wedlin L., Ranking Business Schools: Forming Fields, Identities and Boundaries in International Management Education, (2006); Wilkins S., Huisman J., UK business school rankings over the last 30 years (1980-2010): Trends and explanations, Higher Education, 63, 3, pp. 367-382, (2012); Willmott H., Journal list fetishism and the perversion of scholarship: Reactivity and the ABS list, Organization, 18, 4, pp. 429-442, (2011)","A.

While a universal PPL scheme become operative in 2011 under the Australian Labor Party, alternative policies continued to be proposed by the leader of the Liberal Party. These ranged from an expanded, comparatively generous PPL scheme, to one which would maintain the status quo, to a scheme with lesser provisions than are currently available. This article examines the PPL policy which would have provided the most generous entitlements to employees, and considers how public servants may have fared had it been introduced. The proposal would have meant that public servants would no longer have been able to access PPL provisions in their industrial instruments, but would only have been entitled to the legislated provisions. This article assesses whether public servants may have gained or lost under such a change, and then considers the broader issue of the most appropriate avenues to regulate public sector employment conditions. While a rare opportunity for enhanced PPL has been lost, this may be the best outcome in ensuring that unions can continue to bargain collectively for this important provision and ongoing improvements to it. © © The Author(s) 2015.","Collective bargaining; equality bargaining; gender equality; paid maternity leave; paid parental leave; public sector employment; working conditions","","Abbott T.H., (2014); Abbott T.H., (2015); Big new tax - Abbotts debate over parental leave plan, The 7.30 Report, (2010); Fact Check: The Coalitions Stance on Paid Parental Leave Double Dipping, (2015); Labour Force, Detailed, (2014); Employee Earnings, Benefits and Trade Union Membership, (2014); Dont Trust the Coalition on Paid Parental Leave: What Glitters Isnt Always Gold, (2013); ACTU Letter to the Hon.

Using the automotive industry as a comparative case study, this article compares industry policy in three demographic and geographic giants of the region: China, India and Indonesia. China's dominant position has benefited from a highly 'interventionist' industry policy which places strict conditions on foreign carmakers in joint ventures. This policy has also influenced the emergence of a thriving domestic industry, with state-owned enterprises leading the way. While India has also emerged as a major auto producer, its industry policy has moved away from the joint venture model since the 1990s, with fully foreign-owned operations now playing a much bigger role. In contrast, Indonesia retains a version of the joint venture model while local industry is dominated by Japanese capital. The record of industry policy in these countries challenges the idea that more 'liberal' economic systems lead to stronger domestic industries or firms. © University of New South Wales.","Automotive industry; China; India; Indonesia; industry policy; manufacturing industry; varieties of capitalism","","Amable B., The Diversity of Modern Capitalism, (2003); Aswicahyono H., Basri M.C., Hill H., How not to industrialise?

Three analytic dimensions of renewal are identified and presented, each arising out of a consideration of the debates: union organisation, union capacity and union purpose. The proposition is that an understanding of contemporary unionism involves a consideration of the ways renewal involves a multi-faceted transition in relation to the political economy of trade unionism. The way to understand this characterisation is to reconsider theories about unions in terms of a dialectic, addressing the inter-relationships and integration of union organisation, capacities and purpose. © The Author(s) 2015.","Labour relations; neo-liberalism; social justice; trade unions; union renewal","","Allen V., Militant Trade Unionism, (1966); Angrave D., Charlwood A., Greenwood I., Do economic conditions influence union activism behaviour?, Economic and Industrial Democracy, (2015); Auer P., What's in a name?

Government rhetoric and actions can often influence in desirable ways both the speculative actions that now determine the exchange rate and the effect of exchange rate movements on the domestic economy. Managing the exchange rate should start with Australian support for measures such as the Tobin tax that dampen speculation. In 2008 and 2009, exchange rate changes were helpful in reducing the impact of the global financial crisis on Australia, largely because of a very clear commitment by the Australian government to make preservation of jobs its top priority. In 2009, a rapid rise in the exchange rate was unhelpful. In the short run, little can be done about this, but in the longer run, it is possible to offset the adverse effects. © The Author(s) 2013.","E44; E60; Exchange rates; F30; F41; global financial system; macroeconomic policy; speculation; Tobin tax","","Atkinson A., New Sources of Development Finance, (2004); Bank for International Settlements (Various Years) Triennial Central Bank Survey; Barro R.J., Inflation and growth, Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis Review, 78, 3, pp. 153-169, (1996); Brondolo J., Taxing Financial Transactions: An Assessment of Administrative Feasibility, (2011); Harcourt G.C., Taming speculators and putting the world on course to prosperity: A ""modest proposal, Economic and Political Weekly, 24, 28, pp. 2490-2492, (1994); Harcourt G.C., Capitalism, Socialism and Post-Keynesianism: Selected Essays of G.C.

Evolutionary economics is the answer. It starts from the realistic premise that society and the economy are shaped by competition, but unlike neo-classical economics, it proceeds empirically by observing and analysing what has been happening to the economy and society. It does so on the premise that a process of social selection is taking place, analogous but not identical to that of biological selection. This dynamic approach requires a revival of economic history. By reporting on, and inviting debate over, what is happening and its implications, the adoption of an evolutionary approach should help restore the moral content of economics and the surrounding social sciences. Such a change in approach would be a paradigm shift, and will take time. That it will happen is likely: in the end facts kick. © University of New South Wales.","E14","","Boulding K.E., Evolutionary Economics, (1981); Bowles B., Gintis H., A Cooperative Species: Human Reciprocity and Its Evolution, (2011); Cochran G., Harpending H., The 10,000 Explosion: How Civilisation Accelerated Human Evolution, (2010); Cunningham W., The relativity of economic doctrine, The Economic Journal, 2, 5, pp. 1-16, (1892); Daly M., Wilson M., Homicide, (1988); Darwin C., The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex, (1871); Darwin C., Barlow N., The Autobiography of Charles Darwin, 1809-1882: With Original Omissions Restored, (1887); Dasgupta P., Economics: A Very Short Introduction, (2007); De Waal F., Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are?, (2016); Freeman C., Systems of Innovation: Selected Essays in Evolutionary Economics, (2008); Hahn F., The next hundred years, The Economic Journal, 101, 404, pp. 47-50, (1991); Hamilton W.D., The genetical evolution of social behaviour, Journal of Theoretical Biology, 7, 1, pp. 1-16, (1964); Hayek F.A., The pretence of knowledge, Nobel Prize Lecture, (1974); Hayek F.A., Nishiyama C., Leube K.R., The origins and effects of our morals: A problem for social science, The Essence of Hayek, pp. 318-330, (1984); Heinrich J., The Secret of Our Success: How Culture Is Driving Human Evolution, Domesticating Our Species, and Making Us Smarter, (2016); Kahneman D., Thinking, Fast and Slow, (2011); Kuhn T.S., The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, (1970); Neild R., Public Corruption: The Dark Side of Social Evolution, (2002); Nelson R.R., Winter S.G., An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change, (1982); Runciman W.G., A Treatise on Social Theory, 2, (1989); Runciman W.G., The Social Animal, (1998); Runciman W.G., The Theory of Social and Cultural Selection, (2009); Schumpeter J.A., Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy, (1947); Simon H., Economics, Bounded Rationality and the Cognitive Revolution, (2008); Smith J.M., Evolution and the Theory of Games, (1982); Solow R.M., How did economics get that way and what way did it get?, Daedalus, 126, 1, pp. 39-58, (1997); Veblen T., The Theory of the Leisure Class, (1898); Veblen T., The Instinct of Workmanship and the State of the Industrial Arts, (1914)","R.

For young people seeking careers in creative occupations, the expectation of insecure employment conditions has become normalised. This may be the combined effect of intergenerational changes in the youth labour market generally, and the nature of employment in creative industries at all career stages. The article draws from 80 life history interviews conducted in Western Sydney, Australia, a region with high concentrations of unemployment and low socio-economic status. Their perspectives problematise the common assumption that young creative workers seek to resist insecure patterns of work or long for the stable jobs of the past. Partly, they have accepted the injunction for 'vocational restlessness' in their industries. Both in their 'day jobs' and in their attempts to get into their chosen part of the creative industry, they feel that not staying in one position too long can be both liberating and adaptive. Union campaigns highlighting the perils of insecurity are unlikely to resonate with them. © The Author(s) 2013.","Inequality; J63; job insecurity; precarious work; sociology of work; vulnerable workers","","Australian Labour Market Statistics, (2013);

Recently, the field has attracted criticism for its focus on large-scale economic processes, such as profit accumulation based not on production, but on a diversification of financial risk management tools - a focus which ignores the way in which individuals and households experience financialisation in everyday life. In addressing this gap, theorists have sought to understand financialisation as it relates to individuals as consumers and investors, increasing their need to integrate financial calculation into daily life. This article takes the analysis two steps further. First, it argues that precarious work is actually an aspect of financialisation, based on risk-shifting by employing organisations - a process of structural change in the labour market that actually undermines individual workers' capacity to manage financial risk successfully. Second, it argues that financialisation is an ideology or narrative of individual responsibility, which seeks to legitimate structural change by promising emancipation through individual calculation. It draws on interviews with precarious workers to explore the gap between such norms of financial self-determination and the lived experience of insecure employment. It identifies this paradox of precariousness by focusing on people in professional occupations, who in theory are best placed to successfully negotiate economic change. © The Author(s) 2013.","Employment conditions; financialisation; flexibility; insecurity; J80; J81; neo-liberalism; precarious work","","Allon F., The futility of extrapolation: Reflections on crisis, continuity and culture in the 'Great Recession, Ephemera: Theory and Politics in Organization, 9, 4, pp. 369-379, (2009); Allon F., Speculating on everyday life: The cultural economy of the quotidian, Journal of Communication Inquiry, 34, 4, pp. 366-381, (2010); Australian Labour Market Statistics, (2009); Employee Earnings, Benefits and Trade Union Membership, Australia, (2012); Beck U., Risk Society: Towards A New Modernity, (1992); Beck U., The Brave New World of Work, (2000); Boltanski L., Chiapello E., The New Spirit of Capitalism.

This study analyses the impacts of trade policy on unemployment rates in Nigeria. Using time series data from 1970 to 2010, it adopts the vector error correction methodology. In order to explore the impact of a range of variables on the relationship between trade openness and national unemployment rates, these variables, in a system of equations, include measures of trade openness, public recurrent spending on education, foreign price shocks and real gross domestic product or alternatively income per capita. The findings reveal that in the long run, real output and income per capita lead to a decline in unemployment, but trade openness policy is associated with an increase in unemployment. Foreign policy shocks, as proxied by commodity prices, also exert a positive effect on unemployment rates and do not contribute subsequently to restoring the system to equilibrium. However, the initial impact of openness and foreign price shocks captured by short-term dynamics are observed to reduce unemployment. © The Author(s) 2015.","Cointegration; trade openness; unemployment rate; vector error correction model","","Alawin M., Trade balance and unemployment in Jordan, European Scientific Journal, 9, 7, pp. 143-151, (2013); Bernard A., Redding S., Schott P., Comparative advantage and heterogeneous firms, Review of Economic Studies, 74, 1, pp. 31-66, (2007); Birdsall N., O'Connell L., Putting education to work in Egypt, Conference on Growth beyond Stabilization: Prospects for Egypt; Brecher R., Minimum wage rates and the pure theory of international trade, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 88, 4, pp. 98-116, (1974); Candelon B., Lutkepohl H., On the reliability of Chow-type tests for parameter constancy in multivariate dynamic models, Economics Letters, 73, 2, pp. 155-160, (2001); Statistical Bulletin 20, (2009); Statistical Bulletin 23, (2012); Choudhry M.T., Marelli E., Signorelli M., Financial crises and labour market performance, 69th International Atlantic Economic Conference; Chow G., Tests of equality between sets of coefficients in two linear regressions, Econometrica, 28, 3, pp. 591-603, (1960); Davidson C., Matusz S., International Trade and Labour Markets.

The European Commission selectively relied on econometric analyses, predicting a positive impact of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. Its proposed legal text on 'Trade and sustainable development' fell short of the European Parliament's negotiating guidelines, which themselves failed to ensure protection of labour standards. The activities of corporate lobbies threatened the effective protection of workers' rights. Major risks to workers' rights are posed by discrepancies between US and European Union labour and social law and labour standards. The most recent legal text lacks compliance monitoring provisions and sanction mechanisms against member states failing to ratify core labour conventions. The investment court system does not resolve the problems of the discredited investor-state dispute settlement mechanism for which it is the proposed replacement. The year 2016 has provided a foretaste of the dislocation likely from trade and investment regulation that sees social and environmental standards and labour rights simply as barriers to corporate profits. © University of New South Wales.","Enforcement of standards; labour rights; labour standards; trade agreements; trade policy; Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership","","Akhtar S.I., Jones V.C., Proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP): In brief, Current Politics and Economics of Europe, 24, 1-2, pp. 107-122, (2013); Baker D., The risks of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, Intereconomics, 49, 3, pp. 179-180, (2014); Berden K.G., Francois J., Thelle M., Et al., Non-Tariff Measures in EU-US Trade and Investment - An Economic Analysis, (2009); Best M.C., McGrory M., Pronk A., Et al., The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership: A classical community method-driven economic integration process, Economia & Lavoro, 2, pp. 63-75, (2015); Bickel B., Harmonizing regulations in the financial services industry through the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, Emory International Law Review, 29, 3, pp. 557-587, (2015); Bogg A., Ewing K.D., Finkin M.W., Mundlak G., Freedom of association, Comparative Labor Law, pp. 296-329, (2015); Bolle M.J., Overview of Labor Enforcement Issues in Free Trade Agreements.

The Liberal/National (Coalition) opposition won office in 2013, promising public sector cuts. In this context, the Walton et al. concept of a forcing strategy helps analyse the 2014-2016 bargaining round in the Australian Public Service. A forcing strategy involves three negotiating processes: distributive bargaining to achieve concessions in pay and working conditions, the structuring of attitudes to heighten animosity between the negotiating parties, and the management of internal differences to minimise intragroup conflicts. The Liberal/National (Coalition) government adopted elements of these approaches, requiring Australian Public Service agencies to reduce a range of employment conditions to justify pay increases. Interactions between Australian Public Service management and the principal Australian Public Service trade union, the Community and Public Sector Union became increasingly hostile over the course of the bargaining round. In addition, internal differences emerged between the Australian Public Service Commission, which oversaw the bargaining process, and individual Australian Public Service agencies. We consider the efficacy of this forcing strategy in light of the potential for the Community and Public Sector Union to mobilise its membership to resist such an approach to pay negotiations. © University of New South Wales.","collective bargaining; Distributive bargaining; employment conditions; forcing strategy; industrial action; public sector; trade unions","","Austin A., Remember labor's 'skyrocketing debt'? the coalition's is much worse, Crikey, (2015); Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), Medibank Private Sale Earns Government More Than $5.6 Billion: Proceeds to Be Reinvested in Infrastructure, (2014); Australian Government, Final Budget Outcome, (2013); Interim Arrangements for Recruitment in the Australian Public Service - Guidance for Agencies, (2013); Australian Public Service Statistical Bulletin: State of the Service Series 2013-14, (2014); Australian Government Public Sector Workplace Bargaining Policy and Supporting Guidance, (2014); APSC Statistical Bulletin 2015, (2015); Workplace Bargaining Policy, (2015); Bach S., NHS pay determination and work re-organisation, Employee Relations, 20, 6, pp. 565-576, (1998); Bach S., Europe: changing public service employment relations, Public Service Employment Relations in Europe: Transformation, Modernization or Inertia?, pp. 1-18, (1999); Bach S., Deprivileging the public sector workforce: austerity, fragmentation and service withdrawal in Britain, Economic and Labour Relations Review, 27, 1, (2016); Brown W., Oxenbridge S., The development of cooperative employer/trade union relationships in Britain, Industrielle Beziehungen, 11, 1-2, pp. 143-158, (2004); Cash M., Michaelia cash - appointment to cabinet, Media Release, (2015); Caverley N., Cunningham B., Reflections on public sector-based integrative collective bargaining, Employee Relations, 28, 1, pp. 62-75, (2006); Colebatch T., Before we tackle the budget, let's clarify a few points, Sydney Morning Herald, (2013); DVA Staff Say No!, (2015); DHS Staff Vote, (2015); Industrial Action Kicks off in Human Services Today, (2015); Workers Strike Back over Pay, Rights and Jobs, (2015); 10 Days of Airport Turbulence As Border Force Dispute Escalates, (2015); Concerns Raised about Management Shortcuts during Border Force Strike, (2015); Minister Abetz We Have a Problem, (2015); Who Doesn't Want a Productive, Modern Public Service?, (2015); The Members Strike Back!, (2015); Industrial Action Rolling Out, (2015); Help Us Fight for Jobs, Rights and Services, (2015); Cooper R., The 'New' industrial relations and international economic crisis: australia in 2009, The Journal of Industrial Relations, 52, 3, pp. 261-274, (2010); Creighton B., Stewart A., Labour Law, (2010); Cutcher-Gershenfeld J., Kochan T., Taking stock: collective bargaining at the turn of the century, Industrial and Labour Relations Review, 58, 1, pp. 3-21, (2004); Cutcher-Gershenfeld J., Kochan T., Calhoon Wells J., How do labor and management view the collective bargaining process?, Monthly Labor Review, 121, 10, pp. 23-31, (1998); Cutcher-Gershenfeld J., McHugh P., Power D., Collective bargaining in small firms: Preliminary evidence of fundamental change, Industrial and Labor Relations Review, 49, 2, pp. 195-212, (1996); Easton S., APS union campaign escalates, but can it win?, The Mandarin, (2015); Eaton S., McKersie R., Fonstad N., Taking stock of the Kaiser Permanente partnership story, Negotiation Journal, 20, 1, pp. 47-64, (2004); CPSU, the Community and Public Sector Union v Commonwealth of Australia, (2014); CPSU, the Community and Public Sector Union v Commonwealth of Australia, (2015); CPSU, the Community and Public Sector Union v Commonwealth of Australia, (2015); CPSU, the Community and Public Sector Union v Commonwealth of Australia, (2015); Australian Municipal, Administrative, Clerical and Services Union v Commonwealth of Australia As Represented by Australian Taxation Office [2015] FWC7692, (2015); Fonstad N., McKersie R., Eaton S., Interest based negotiations in a transformed labor-management setting, Negotiation Journal, 20, 1, pp. 5-11, (2004); Fraser J., Australia's Economic Policy Challenges, (2015); Hockey J., Budget Speech 2014-15.

Yet, despite Australia's long history of industrial activism and political representation of labour, there are fewer examples of social or political movements in Australia resisting precarious work than in Europe. This article provides a partial explanation of this puzzling lack of social resistance to casual employment. It begins from the idea, developed by the Frankfurt School tradition of critical social theory, that economic systems can create or sustain norms that conceal their more harmful social effects from public view. It then uses conceptual categories drawn from critical social theory to show how individual and social costs of casual employment have been overlooked or 'reified' in the workplace and in public political discourse. The study is based on existing qualitative research and on a new analysis of attitudes to work and economic organisation in Australian public discourse. © The Author(s) 2013.","Decent work; flexibility;

A clear conceptualisation would separate out five analytical levels: precariousness in employment, precarious work, precarious workers individually and as an emerging class, and precarity as a general condition of social life. To illustrate the need to avoid slippage between the concepts of precarious work and precarious workers, we present one 'theory-relevant' example - full-time secondary school students in Australia who hold part-time jobs in the retail sector. Their part-time jobs are indeed precarious but the negative effects on the student-workers are modest, both because participation in precarious work is limited (moderate weekly hours and intermittent work within the framework of a brief stage of the life course) and because many (though not all) of the associated risks are cushioned by structural forces such as access to alternative income sources and career paths. At the same time, however, a longitudinal perspective reveals that the same group of student-workers faces major risks in the future, as a result of increasingly insecure labour markets. Reflections on this example help to identify conceptual tools that can be applied to a wide range of other examples of precarious work. © University of New South Wales.","Employment conditions; job quality; labour market insecurity; life course; precarious work; retail; vulnerable workers; young workers","","Abhayaratna J., Andrews L., Nuch H., Et al., Part Time Employment: The Australian Experience, (2008); Anderson B., Migration, immigration controls and the fashioning of precarious workers, Work, Employment and Society, 24, 2, pp. 300-317, (2010); Anlezark A., Lim P., Does Combining School and Work Affect School and Post-School Outcomes?, (2011); Archer M., Realist Social Theory: The Morphogenetic Approach, (1995); Arnold D., Bongiovi J., Precarious, informalizing, and flexible work: Transforming concepts and understandings, American Behavioral Scientist, 57, 3, pp. 289-308, (2013); Employee Earnings, Benefits and Trade Union Membership, Australia, August, (2013); Australian Labour Market Statistics, (2014); Table 15: Labour Force Status by Sex and Educational Attendance - Persons Aged 15 to 19 Years, (2015); Table 22: Underutilised Persons by Age and Sex: Trend, Seasonally Adjusted and Original, (2015); Work-Related Injury Hospitalisations, Australia 2002-03 and 2003-04, (2007); Retail Workforce Study, (2014); Bray M., Stewart A., What is distinctive about the Fair Work regime?, Australian Journal of Labour Law, 26, 1, pp. 20-49, (2013); Breman J., A bogus concept, New Left Review, 84, pp. 130-138, (2013); Burawoy M., The Extended Case Method: Four Countries, Four Decades, Four Great Transformations and One Theoretical Tradition, (2009); Burchell B., Sehnbruch K., Piasna A., Et al., The quality of employment and decent work: Definitions, methodologies, and ongoing debates, Cambridge Journal of Economics, 38, 2, pp. 459-477, (2014); Burgess J., Connell J., Winterton J., Vulnerable workers, precarious work and the role of trade unions and HRM, The International Journal of Human Resource Management, 24, 22, pp. 4083-4093, (2013); Campbell I., Casual work and casualisation: How does Australia compare?, Labour and Industry, 15, 2, pp. 85-111, (2004); Campbell I., Chalmers J., Job quality and part-time work in the retail industry: An Australian case study, International Journal of Human Resource Management, 19, 3, pp. 487-500, (2008); Carnie L., Towards Fairness and Equality for Young Workers: Youth Wages and Minimum Shift Lengths, (2012); Carre F., Tilly C., Van Klaveren M., Gautie J., Schmitt J., Et al., Retail jobs in comparative perspective, Low-Wage Work in the Wealthy World, pp. 211-268, (2010); Chalmers J., Evans E., Baxter J., Occupational standing over the life course: What is the role of part time work?, Negotiating the Life Course: Stability and Change in Life Pathways, pp. 191-214, (2013); Clement W., Mathieu S., Prus S., Vosko L., MacDonald M., Campbell I., Et al., Precarious lives in the new economy: Comparative intersectional analysis, Gender and the Contours of Precarious Employment, pp. 240-255, (2009); Cooke G., Donaghey J., Zeytinoglu I., The nuanced nature of work quality: Evidence from rural Newfoundland and Ireland, Human Relations, 66, 4, pp. 503-527, (2013); Creighton B., Stewart A., Labour Law, (2010); Cuervo H., Wyn J., Rethinking Youth Transitions in Australia: A Historical and Multidimensional Approach, (2011); Edwards P., The challenging but promising future of industrial relations: Developing theory and method in context-sensitive research, Industrial Relations Journal, 36, 4, pp. 264-282, (2005); Eisenhardt K., Huberman A., Miles M., Building theories from case study research, The Qualitative Researcher's Companion, pp. 5-36, (2002); Chapter 5.

Increasingly, sophisticated regression techniques require the availability of appropriate data sets, often longitudinal and typically collected at a national level. This raises challenges for researchers seeking to investigate issues requiring data that are not typically included in regular large-scale data. It also raises questions of the adequacy of relying mainly or solely on regression analysis for investigating key issues of economic theory and policy. One way of addressing these issues is to employ a mixed-methods research framework to investigate important research questions. In this article, we provide an example of applying a mixed-methods design to investigate the employment decisions of mature age women working in the aged care sector. We outline the use of a coherent and robust framework to allow the integrated collection and analysis of quantitative and qualitative data. Drawing on particular examples from our analysis, we show how a mixed-methods approach facilitates richer insights, more finely grained understandings of causal relationships and identification of emergent issues. We conclude that mixed-methods research has the capacity to provide surprises and generate new insights through detailed exploratory data analysis. © The Author(s) 2014.","Employment conditions; Gender; Low-paid workers; Mixed methods; Research methodology","","Austen S., Ong R., The effects of ill-health and informal care roles on the employment retention of mid-life women: Does the workplace matter?, Journal of Industrial Relations, (2013); Barker D.K., Emancipatory for whom?

Cadde, Turkey","This article argues that the current global economic crisis is an outcome of the excessive growth of the financial market over the real economy, and hence, of fictitious profits over real profits. In investigating the interrelation between the financial market and the real economy, it makes a comparative inquiry into two key assertions regarding economic crisis within Marxism: the tendency for the rate of profit to fall and overaccumulation of capital. Accepting the claim that economic crisis is inherent to capitalism, this article probes the role of countervailing tendencies in battling the tendency for the rate of profit to fall. While crisis is an outcome of both the extensive growth of fictitious profits and the tendency for the rate of profit to fall, the latter is identified as the fundamental reason for the current crisis. Labour market reforms that were implemented following the emergence of the economic crisis represent the resurgence of countervailing tendencies and are the most explicit evidence that the fundamental reason for the crisis resides in the real economy. © The Author(s) 2014.","Current global economic crisis; Fictitious profit; Financial market; Labour market reform; Marxist theories of crisis; Overaccumulation; Rate of profit; Real economy; Real profit","","Bahce S., Kose A.H., Krizin teǧet geçtiǧi ülkeden krize bakiş: Teorinin naifliǧi gerçekliǧin kabaliǧi [Crisis from the perspective of the country which is merely grazed by it: Naivety of theory, crudeness of reality], Praksis [Praxis], 22, pp. 9-40, (2010); Bonefeld W., Monetarism and crisis, Global Capital, National State and the Politics of Money, pp. 35-68, (1996); Bonefeld W., Globalisation and human progress, Money and Class Struggle during the Era of Globalisation, pp. 111-131, (2007); Bonefeld W., Holloway J., Conclusion: Money and class struggle, Global Capital, National State and the Politics of Money, pp. 210-227, (1996); Bonefeld W., Brown A., Burnham P., A Major Crisis? the Politics of Economic Policy in Britain in the 1990s, (1995); Boratav K., Uluslararasi kriz üzerine birkaç gözlem [Observations on international crisis], Eǧitim Bilim Toplum [Education Science Society], 7, 27, pp. 9-15, (2009); Callinicos A., Bonfire of Illusions: The Twin Crisis of the Liberal World, (2010); Carchedi G., Behind and beyond the crisis, International Socialism, 132, (2011); Clarke S., Marx's Theory of Crisis, (1994); Clarke S., Yeni solcular' sinif vurgusunu geriye atiyor [New leftists repelling the class emphasis], Birgün Gazetesi [Birgün Newspaper], (2009); Dumenil G., Levy D., The profit rate: Where and how much did it fall?

The post-1997 Asian crisis and democratic Indonesia mimic the global trend of disconnection between wages and productivity: labour productivity continues to rise while real wage-earning stagnates or declines. This disconnection has three consequences. First, it affects income or earning distribution as confirmed by rising overall earnings inequality. Second, while it explains the conventional wisdom of an economy-wide negative relationship between real wages and employment, it is of concern that these two variables do not move in the same direction as the productivity improvements that have occurred in large and medium establishments in the manufacturing sector. Third, the disconnection between productivity and earnings growth opens a new discussion on the broader issue of quality of growth, as the data show that robust economic growth in the post-crisis Indonesia has not been accompanied by parallel improvements in the quality of employment. © University of New South Wales.","Earnings inequality; economic growth; employment growth; employment quality; income distribution; Indonesia; productivity; wage dispersion","","Asra A., Poverty and inequality in Indonesia: Estimates, decomposition and key issues, Journal of the Asia Pacific Economy, 5, 1-2, pp. 91-111, (2000); Blanchard O., Katz L., Wage dynamics: Reconciling theory and evidence, American Economic Review, 89, 2, pp. 69-74, (1999); Cederman L.E., Gleditsch K.S., Buhaug H., Inequality, Grievances, and Civil War, (2013); Chowdhury A., Islam I., Tadjoeddin M.Z., Indonesia's employment challenges: Growth, structural change and labour market rigidity, European Journal of East Asian Studies, 8, 1, pp. 31-59, (2009); Chun N., Khor N., Minimum Wages and Changing Wage Inequality in Indonesia, (2010); Cobham A., Sumner A., Putting the Gini Back in the Bottle?

The economic crisis precipitated austerity measures concentrated on expenditure reductions with the intention of reducing the public deficit. Because the public sector pay bill comprises over half of current public spending, achieving deficit reduction has major consequences for the total pay bill and the workforce. This article assesses the restructuring of the public sector and public sector employment relations in Britain and identifies underlying continuities in public sector restructuring over recent decades. Drawing on and repositioning New Labour's legacy, the Coalition government used the economic crisis to establish a pro-austerity frame that has legitimated deep cuts in public sector employment and involved measures to refashion public sector employment relations. The article considers the consequences of this agenda and responses by trade unions and indicates some of the limits and uncertain prospects for public sector restructuring under conditions of austerity. © University of New South Wales.","Austerity; employment conditions; global financial crisis; managerialism; public sector management; trade unions","","Appleby J., Baird B., Thompson J., Et al., The NHS under Coalition Government: Part Two: NHS Performance, (2015); Bach S., Shrinking the state or the big society?

Based on data from the Australian household panel Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia, the article is the first to establish these gaps in Australia, and to examine the degree to which credence can be afforded to claims that endowments such as personality traits may help explain such wage differentials. Using ordinary least squares and Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition methods, the study explicitly includes the battery of Big Five personality traits in wage regressions and estimates the contribution of endowments and returns to these traits. The finding is that personality traits and returns to them do not differ along lines of sexual orientation. Gay men in particular suffer a substantial unexplained wage penalty in the workplace. Such unexplained differences suggest that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, though unlawful, may exist in Australia. © The Author(s) 2015.","Discrimination; personality; sexual orientation; wage decomposition; wage determination; wage gaps","","Ahmed A.M., Hammarstedt M., Sexual orientation and earnings: A register data-based approach to identify homosexuals, Journal of Population Economics, 23, pp. 835-849, (2010); Allegretto S.A., Arthur M.M., An empirical analysis of homosexual/heterosexual male earnings differentials: Unmarried and unequal?, Industrial and Labor Relations Review, 54, 3, pp. 658-686, (2001); Antecol H., Jong A., Steinberger M., The sexual orientation wage gap: The role of occupational sorting, and human capital?, Industrial and Labor Relations Review, 61, (2007); Arabsheibani G.R., Marin A., Wadsworth J., Gay pay in the UK, Economica, 72, 286, pp. 333-347, (2005); Arulampalam W., Booth A.L., Bryan M.L., Is there a glass ceiling over Europe?

Most of the increase in the wealth gap was associated with a relatively rapid increase in the value of housing assets by single men over the study period. The findings of this study challenge a wider literature that tends to emphasise that men are more prepared to invest in 'risky' assets such as shares and that their higher wealth is due to these investment strategies. Instead, this study emphasises how, in the Australian context at least, it was higher growth rates in the value of housing assets owned by single men that improved their wealth position relative to single women over the last decade. © The Author(s) 2014.","Assets; Australia; gender; portfolio composition; wealth","","Austen S., Jefferson T.M., Ong R., The gender gap in financial security: What we know and don't know about Australian households, Feminist Economics, 20, 3, pp. 25-52, (2014); Average Weekly Earnings, Australia, (2013); Bertocchi G., Brunetti M., Torricelli C., Portfolio choices, gender and marital status, Rivista di Politica Economica, 98, 5, pp. 119-154, (2008); Bloxham P., Betts T., Measures of household wealth for Australia, Australian Economic Review, 42, 2, pp. 217-231, (2009); Bolin K., Palsson A., Male and female wealth: The importance of the family structure, Prepared for the 21st Arne Ryde Symposium on Non-human Wealth and Capital Accumulation; Deere C.D., Doss C.R., The gender asset gap: What do we know and why does it matter, Feminist Economics, 12, 12, pp. 1-50, (2006); Denton M., Boos L., The gender wealth gap: Structural and material constraints and implications for later life, Journal of Women & Aging, 19, 34, pp. 105-120, (2007); De Silva A., Wood G., Melbourne house prices: Safe as houses?, Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology Blog Post, 30May, (2011); Headey B., Marks G., Wooden M., The structure and distribution of wealth in Australia, Australian Economic Review, 38, pp. 159-175, (2005); Jefferson T., Women and retirement incomes in Australia: A review, Economic Record, 81, 254, pp. 273-294, (2005); Parr N., Ferris S., Mahuteau S., The impact of children on Australian women's and men's superannuation, Economic and Labour Relations Review, 18, 1, pp. 3-26, (2007); Schmidt L., Sevak P., Gender, marriage, and asset accumulation in the United States, Feminist Economics, 12, 12, pp. 139-166, (2006); Sierminska E.M., Frick J.R., Grabka M.M., Examining the gender wealth gap, Oxford Economic Papers, 62, 4, pp. 669-690, (2010); Smith S., Income, housing wealth, and gender inequality, Urban Studies, 27, 1, pp. 67-88, (1990); Warren T., Moving beyond the gender wealth gap: On gender, class, ethnicity, and wealth inequalities in the United Kingdom, Feminist Economics, 12, 1, pp. 195-219, (2006); Warren T., Rowlingson K., Whyley C., Female finances: Gender wage gaps and gender assets gaps, Work, Employment & Society, 15, 3, pp. 465-488, (2001); Wood G., Ong R., Factors shaping the dynamics of housing affordability in Australia 2001-2006, Housing Studies, 26, 78, pp. 1105-1127, (2011); Yamokoski A., Keister L., The wealth of single women: Marital status and parenthood in the asset accumulation of young baby boomers in the United States, Feminist Economics, 12, 1, pp. 167-194, (2006)","S.

This precariousness is often traced back to the sphere of employment, though recent research also points to the implications of the limited rights entailed by temporary migrant status. This article draws on empirical work among registered nurses who have participated in the Australian 457 visa scheme - the major programme for temporary migrant workers in Australia. Using a range of empirical sources, including in-depth interviews with 26 temporary migrant nurses, we examine whether these nurses experience precariousness and locate the sites and sources of precariousness. The article draws attention to the importance of the regulatory context that defines different pathways from the country of departure to employment in the Australian healthcare system. We suggest that, although temporary migrant nurses are well integrated within the healthcare workforce in terms of formal wages and conditions, other stages in their migration pathways can be associated with precariousness. This in turn has significant impact on experiences at work and outside the workplace. © The Author(s) 2013.","J15; J48; J61; Migrant workers; migration; migration pathways; nurse migration; precarious migrant status;

But critics argue that it has delivered few benefits to the wider population. In this context, industry advocates have drawn attention to the direct and indirect impact of IT on output and employment. This article critically explores these claims by locating them in the conventional (neoliberal) narrative of India's recent economic development. It finds that industry claims are exaggerated and that IT industry demand is often linked to the creation of employment in industries dominated by informal employment arrangements. The prevalence of informal employment highlights problems of low pay and poor or hazardous working conditions. The IT industry's rise to prominence has traversed a deeply ingrained process of labour market informalisation.

Results indicate that green card farm workers tend to allocate fewer workweeks to farm employment than citizens and undocumented workers, in favour of better opportunities in the non-farm sector. There is evidence of an assimilation effect, whereby undocumented workers also tend to re-allocate their time from farm to non-farm employment as their residence tenure increases, even though they experience constrained mobility and visibility during periods of strict immigration control. In the context of employers' violations of the existing labour laws that currently protect even the rights of undocumented workers, such turnover decisions seem justified. The findings raise concerns about whether any governmental effort to legalise the immigration status of such workers would reduce farm job turnover rates and increase farm employment retention, so long as labour standards are not enforced. Moreover, external economic shocks could more easily induce citizen and green card farm workers to abandon farm employment, whereas undocumented workers tend to remain in their farm jobs during such difficult times. © University of New South Wales.","Agricultural labour markets; employee retention; farm work; immigration; labour rights violations; non-farm employment; time allocation; undocumented farm workers; unemployment; working hours","","Acquaye A.K., Alston J.M., Pardey P.G., Post-war productivity patterns in U.S. Agriculture: Influences of aggregation procedures in a state-level analysis, American Journal of Agricultural Economics, 85, 1, pp. 59-80, (2003); Adsera A., Chiswick B.R., Are there gender and country of origin differences in immigrant labor market outcomes across European destinations?, Journal of Population Economics, 20, 3, pp. 495-526, (2007); Ahearn M.C., El-Osta H., Mishra A.K., Considerations in Work choices of US farm households: The role of health insurance, Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics, 38, 1, pp. 19-33, (2013); Ahituv A., Kimhi A., Simultaneous estimation of work choices and the level of farm activity using panel data, European Review of Agricultural Economics, 33, 1, pp. 49-71, (2006); Atamanov A., Van Den Berg M., Participation and returns in rural nonfarm activities: Evidence from the Kyrgyz Republic, Agricultural Economi, 43, 4, pp. 459-471, (2012); Bjornsen H.M., Biorn E., Interrelated labor decisions of farm couples: A censored response analysis of off-farm work, Agricultural Economics, 41, 6, pp. 595-610, (2010); Bray I., Legal Rights of Undocumented Immigrants, (2016); Bump P., Where America's undocumented immigrants work, The Washington Post, (2015); Calvin L., Martin P., The U.S. Produce Industry and Labor: Facing the Future in A Global Economy, (2010); Contreras R.L., Yes, illegal aliens have constitutional rights, The Hill, (2015); Economic Report of the President, (2013); De Janvry A., Sadoulet E., Income strategies among rural households in Mexico: The role of off-farm activities, World Development, 29, 3, pp. 467-480, (2001); El-Osta H.S., Mishra A.K., Ahearn M.C., Labor supply by farm operators under 'decoupled' farm program payments, Review of Economics of the Household, 2, 4, pp. 367-385, (2004); Emerson R.D., Agricultural labor markets and immigration, Choices, 22, 1, pp. 57-66, (2007); Escalante C.L., Perkins S.L., Santos F.I., When the seasonal foreign farm workers are gone, Journal of the American Society of Farm Managers and Rural Appraisers, 74, 1, pp. 83-96, (2011); Escalante C.L., Wu Y., Li X., Organic farms' seasonal farm labor sourcing strategies in the pre-'Arizona' mode of immigration control, Applied Economics Letters, 23, 5, pp. 341-346, (2016); Garcia R.J., Ten years after Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc.

While unions have a direct effect on the labour market via wage negotiations, they often also take part in political debates. In many countries, significant shares of the members of parliament are also members of a trade union. However, up to now little empirical evidence is available on the extent to which unionised members of parliament try to achieve union-specific goals and thereby influence the macroeconomic conditions of an economy. A recent study for Germany comes to the conclusion that union members in the Bundestag cannot be seen as the parliamentary arm of the trade unions. However, we present contradicting empirical results by showing that, in Germany at least, the degree of unionisation of parliamentary members has a negative impact on economic growth and increases inflation, while unemployment remains unaffected. © 2011 University of New South Wales.","Growth; inflation; political representation; trade unions; unemployment","","Alesina A., Macroeconomic policy in a two-party system as a repeated game, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 102, 3, pp. 651-678, (1987); Bain G.S., Elsheikh F., Union Growth and the Business Cycle: An Econometric Analysis, (1976); Bassanini A., Duval R., Unemployment, institutions, and reform complementaries: Re-assessing the aggregate evidence for OECD countries, Oxford Review of Economic Policy, 25, 1, pp. 40-59, (2009); Bodman P.M., Trade union amalgamations, openness and the decline in Australian trade union membership, Australian Bulletin of Labour, 24, 1, pp. 18-45, (1998); Bruno M., Sachs J., Economics of World Stagflation, (1985); Buchanan J.M., An economic theory of clubs, Economica, 32, 125, pp. 1-14, (1965); Calmfors L., Booth A., Burda M., Checci M., Naylor R., Visser J., The Role of Unions in the Twenty-First Century, pp. 1-155, (2001); Calmfors L., Drifill J., Bargaining structure, corporatism, and macroeconomic performance, Economic Policy, 6, pp. 16-61, (1988); Carruth A., Disney R., Where have two million trade union members gone?, Economica, 55, 1, pp. 1-19, (1988); Carruth A., Schnabel C., Empirical modelling of trade union growth in Germany, 1956-1986: Traditional versus cointegration and error correction methods, Weltwirtschaftliches Archiv, 126, 2, pp. 326-346, (1990); Checci D., Nunziata L., Models of unionism and unemployment, European Journal of Industrial Relations, 17, 2, pp. 141-152, (2011); Cornes R., Sandler T., The Theory of Externalities, Public Goods and Club Goods, (1999); Eckstein Z., Tsiddon D., Macroeconomic consequences of terror: Theory and the case of Israel, Journal of Monetary Economics, 51, 5, pp. 971-1002, (2004); Engels F., The Condition of the Working Class in England, (1887); Flanagan R.J., Has management strangled U.S. Unions?, Journal of Labor Research, 26, 1, pp. 33-63, (2005); Freeman R.B., What Do Unions Do? the 2004 M-Brane Stringtwister Edition, Journal of Labor Research, 26, 4, pp. 641-668, (2005); Freeman R.B., Medoff J.L., What Do Unions Do?, (1984); Hassel A., Die Fünfte Kolonne.

This is contrary to claims of a reduced, withered or slimmed neoliberal state. The Australian state's interventions have become increasingly varied in the overwhelming pursuit of structural competitiveness. It has developed an extensive 'micro-structuring' role, particularly through the creation of new regulatory instruments and institutions, but has not relinquished its economic 'macro-structuring' role notwithstanding changes to macroeconomic policy priorities. The Australian state's interventions have shaped all institutional forms comprising the mode of regulation that guides and supports the accumulation regime.

A recent Australian government response to pay concerns was to call on the Productivity Commission (PC) to investigate the oversight, accountability and transparency of remuneration practices. At least two PC-related outcomes were controversial: the 'two strikes' and 'clawback' proposals. This article considers the reactions of two key stakeholders, namely the Australian Institute of Company Directors and the Business Council of Australia. The views of these two organisations reflect an ongoing evaluation of rules- and principles-based governance structures. Asserting the need to consider alternate analytical models when studying executive pay, the present article concludes with several questions about the intent(s) driving remuneration reforms and their possible consequences.","Accountability of remuneration practices; Executive remuneration; Governance structures; Remuneration reforms","","A Guide for Superannuation Trustees to Monitor Listed Australian Companies, (2009); CEO Pay in the Top 100 Companies: 2010, (2011); Position Paper No. 15: Remuneration Reports, (2010); Flawed executive pay laws passed by Parliament, (2011); Getting ready for the new pay laws, The Boardroom Report, 9, 16, (2011); Submission to Federal Treasury on Discussion Paper, The Clawback of Executive Remuneration where Financial Statements are Materially Misstated, (2011); The sway in executive pay, The Boardroom Report, 9, 20, (2011); Government to implement more executive pay changes, The Boardroom Report, 10, 4, (2012); Prudential Standard CPS 510: Governance, (2010); Principles of Good Corporate Governance and Best Practice Recommendations, (2003); Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations, (2007); (2004); 2010 Australian Share Ownership Study, (2010); Barringer B.R., Harrison J.S., Walking a tightrope: Creating value through interorganisational relationships, Journal of Management, 26, 3, pp. 367-403, (2000); Bartholomeusz S., Executive pay report on the money, Business Spectator, (2011); Submission to the Productivity Commission Discussion Draft on Executive Remuneration in Australia, (2009); Government response pays sound attention to executive remuneration recommendations, (2010); Submission to the Treasury regarding the Clawback of Executive Remuneration where Financial Statements Are Materially Misstated, (2011); Bebchuk L.A., Fried J.M., Pay without performance: Overview of the issues, Journal of Corporation Law, 30, 4, pp. 647-672, (2005); Bender R., Why do companies use performance-related pay for their executive directors?, Corporate Governance: An International Review, 12, 4, pp. 521-533, (2004); Bhagat S., Black B., The uncertain relationship between board composition and firm performance, The Business Lawyer, 54, 3, pp. 921-963, (1999); Bosch H., Corporate Practices and Conduct, (1995); Bowen C., Government responds to the Productivity Commission report on executive remuneration, (2010); Bradbury D., Reforms to further enhance Australia's executive remuneration framework, (2012); Executive Remuneration: Report, (2011); Capezio A., Shields J., O'Donnell M., Too good to be true: Board structural independence as a moderator of CEO pay-for-firm-performance, Journal of Management Studies, 48, 3, pp. 487-513, (2011); Colvin J.H.C., More red tape for directors, Company Director, 27, (2011); The Clawback of Executive Remuneration where Financial Statements are Materially Misstated, (2010); Q and A with John H.C.

A primary aim of the study was to interrogate the notion that public housing is a form of housing tenure that is no longer worth pursuing due to it being a harbinger of misery and social exclusion for its residents. The research suggests that this conclusion is, in many ways, mythology. For the older public housing tenants interviewed, being accommodated in this tenure form was viewed as a 'life-saver'. Despite the ever-increasing re- sidualisation of public housing, the provision of affordable, adequate and secure accommodation in convenient locations gave them the capacity to pursue a life that they valued.","","","Rent Assistance: Does It Deliver Ajfordability?, (2003); Media Release: Most Public Housing Tenants Happy with Their Accommodation, (2005); Arthurson K., Social Inclusion and Community Regeneration: Is the Role of Public Housing Excluded?, (2003); Public Housing, Volume, 2, 34, (1993); Conley D., Gifford B., Home ownership, social insurance, and the welfare state, Sociological Forum, 21, 1, pp. 55-82, (2006); Esping-Andersen G., The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism, (1990); Evans G., Kantrowitz E., Eshelman P., Housing quality and psychological well-being among the elderly population, The Journals of Gerontology Series B: Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences, 57, pp. 381-383, (2002); Habibis D., Atkinson R., Dunbar T., Goss D., Easthope H., Maginn P., A Sustaining Tenancies Approach to Managing Demanding Behaviour in Public Housing: A Good Practice Guide, (2007); Hall J., Berry M., The financial impact of welfare targeting in public housing, AHUPJ Research and Policy Bulletin, 89, (2007); Heintjes A.-M., Housing management practice and support, AHURI Research and Policy Bulletin, 71, (2006); Hiscock A., Kearns A., MacIntyre S., Ellaway A., Ontological security and psycho-social benefits from the home: Qualitative evidence on issues of tenure, Housing, Theory and Society, 18, pp. 50-66, (2001); Rent and Sales Report, 80, (2007); Changes to Public Housing, (2007); Lease Review, New South Wales Government, (2008); Income Eligibility Limits, (2008); Marston G., Metaphor, morality and myth: A critical discourse analysis of public housing policy in Queensland, Critical Social Policy, 20, 3, pp. 349-373, (2000); McIntosh G., Reforming Public Housing, Current Issues, (1996); Morris A., Living on the margins: The worlds of older private renters in Sydney, Australian Journal of Human Rights, 12, 1, pp. 205-221, (2006); Morris A., On the edge: The financial situation of older renters in the private rental market in Sydney, Australian Journal of Social Issues, 42, 3, pp. 337-350, (2007); Nettleton S., Burrows R., Mortgage debt, insecure home ownership and health: An exploratory analysis, Sociology of Health and Illness, 20, 5, pp. 437-461, (1998); Randolph B., Judd B., Community renewal and large public housing estates, Urban Policy and Research, 18, 1, pp. 91-104, (2000); Saunders P., Can Social Exclusion Provide A New Framework for Measuring Poverty?, (2003); Sen A., Development As Freedom, (1999); Sennett R., Respect: The Formation of Character in the Age of Inequality, (2003); Excluded Older People: Social Exclusion Unit Interim Report, (2005); Wulff M., The 'National Survey of Rent Assistance Recipients: A Report on Key Findings, (2000); Yates J., Changing directions in Australian housing policies: The end of muddling through?, Housing Studies, 12, 2, pp. 265-277, (1997); Yates J., Randolph B., Holloway D., Housing Affordability, Occupation and Location in Australian Cities and Regions, (2006); Yates J., Milligan V., Berry M., Burke T., Gabriel M., Phibbs P., Pinnegar S., Randolph B., Housing affordability: A 21<sup>st</sup> century problem, Final Report, National Research Venture 3: Housing Affordability for Lower Income Australians, (2007)","","","SAGE Publications Ltd","10353046","","","","English","Econ.

Web-based systems of collaboration between and within firms and their customers, as well as customer engagement in product innovation, have underscored claims about the evaporation of traditional labour markets and labour processes as well as about (weakening) divisions between production and consumption. This has led to (exaggerated) debates about the contribution of free' or 'immaterial' labour to contemporary economies. This paper argues that while significant restructuring has changed traditional organisational forms, capital markets remain centralised and digital labour remains as regulated as other labour. As such, while labour cannot be fully commodified, digital labour is neither free or immaterial, because it is not the content of labour itself, but rather its relationship with capital that gives it 'weight' and value.","","","AOL; Barbrook R., The hi-tech gift economy, First Monday, 3, 12, (1998); Bell D., The Coming of Post-Industrial Society: A Venture in Social Forecasting, (1974); Boyle J., Shamans Software and Spleens: Law and the Construction of the Information Society, (1997); Brinkley I., Fauth R., Mahdon M., Theodoropoulou S., Knowledge Workers and Knowledge Work: A Knowledge Economy Programme Report, (2009); Castells M., The Rise of the Network Society, (1996); Clegg S., Modern Organizations: Organization Studies in the Postmodern World, (1990); Coyle B., Weightless World: Strategies for Managing the Digital Economy, (1997); Felsted A., Jewson N., Walters S., Changing Places of Work, (2005); Frezza B., The future of money in the information age,  Annual Monetary Conference, (1996); Goffman E., The Presentation of the Self in Everyday Life, (1971); Gorz A., Reclaiming Work: Beyond the Wage-Based Society, (1999); Grossman L., Power to the people, Time Magazine, (2006); Handy C., The Future of Work, (1984); Hardt M., Negri A., Empire, (2000); Harrison B., Lean and Mean: The Changing Landscape of Corporate Power in the Age of Flexibility, (1994); Heckscher C., The changing social contract for white collar workers, Perspectives on Work, 1, 1, pp. 18-21, (1997); Hochschild A.R., The Managed Heart: Commercialisation of Human Feeling, (1983); Huws U., Material world: The myth of the weightless economy, The Socialist Register, (1999); Huws U., Knell J., Most Wanted: The Quiet Birth of the Free Worker, (2000); Jenkins H., Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide, (2006); Lazzarato N., General Intellect: Towards an Inquiry into Immaterial Labour; Lazzarato N., Immaterial labour, Radical Thought in Italy: A Potential Politics, pp. 133-147, (1996); Leidner R., Emotional labor in service work, Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 561, pp. 81-95, (1993); Margonelli L., Inside AOL's ""cyber-Sweatshop"", (1999); Malecki E., Moriset B., The Digital Economy: Business Organization, Production Processes and Regional Developments, (2007); Mathews J., Age of Democracy: The Politics of Post-Fordism, (1989); Moore P., Taylor P., Exploitation of the self in community-based software production: Workers' freedoms or firm foundations?, Capital and Class, 97, pp. 99-120, (2009); Labour Market Trends, 113, 10, pp. 405-436, (2005); Ogbonna E., Wilkinson B., Corporate strategy and corporate culture: The management of change in the UK supermarket industry, Personnel Review, 17, 6, pp. 10-14, (1988); Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development, (2008); Labour Force Statistics, (2008); Pocock B., Prosser R., Bridge K., The return of ""labour-as-commodity?"" the experience of casual work,  Conference of the Association of Industrial Relations Academics of Australia and New Zealand, pp. 459-467, (2005); Postigo H., Of mods and modders: Chasing down the value of fan-based digital game modifications, Games and Culture, 2, 4, pp. 300-313, (2007); Putnam L., Mumby D.K., Organizations, emotion and the myth of rationality, Emotions in Organizations, pp. 36-57, (1993); Quah D., Increasingly weightless economies, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, 37, 1, pp. 49-56, (1997); Shanahan D., Rowbotham J., Howard on Internet Porn Crusade, (2007); Smith A., Of the accumulation of capital, or of unproductive and labour, The Anthology of Development and Globalisation: Prom Classical Political Economy to Contemporary Neo Liberalism, (2005); Soderberg J., Hacking Capitalism: The Free and Open Source Software Movement, (2008); Terranova T., Network Culture: Politics for the Information Age, (2004); Terranova T., Producing culture for the digital economy, Social Text, 63, 2, pp. 33-57, (2000); Thompson P., Foundation and empire: A critique of hardt and negri, Capital and Clan, 86, pp. 73-98, (2005); Tibbetts J., Calgary Herald, (2009); Toffler A., The Third Wave, (1980); Vosko L.F., Temporary Work.

One outcome of the legislation has been a proliferation of extremely comprehensive analyses of its effects to date. This review article on those reports concludes that the overwhelming weight of evidence is that the legislation has benefited employers at the expense of employees. However, this article provides a materialist analysis of Work Choices and the wider employer offensive which contrasts with the dominant interpretations amongst the critics of Work Choices. The paper situates Work Choices as part of a longer-term employer offensive designed to maintain profitability by increasing the rate of labour exploitation.","","","ABS (Australian Bureau of Statistics), Australian System of National Accounts, 2006-07, (2007); ACTU (Australian Council of Trade Unions), Real Wages Go Backwards Under Work Choices: Harvester Decision Anniversary, (2007); Baird M., Cooper R., Oliver D., Down and out with workchoices: The impact of workchoices on the work and lives of women in low paid employment, A Report to the Office of Industrial Relations, (2007); Bramble T., Contradictions in Australia's ""Miracle Economy, Journal of Australian Political Economy, 54, pp. 5-31, (2004); Braverman H., Labor and monopoly capital, The Degradation of Work in the Twentieth Century, (1974); Callinicos A., The Revolutionary Ideas of Karl Marx, (2004); Charlesworth S., Macdonald F., Going too far: WorkChoices and the experience of 30 Victorian workers in minimum wage sectors, A Report to Industrial Relations Victoria, prepared by the Centre for Applied Social Research, (2007); Ellem B., Women and work research group, More Work, Less Choice: The Impact of National Labour Re-Regulation on Low-Paid Women Workers in the Australian Capital Territory, (2007); Elton J., Bailey J., Baird M., Charlesworth S., Cooper R., Ellem B., Jefferson T., Macdonald F., Oliver D., Pocock B., Preston A., Whitehouse G., Women and WorkChoices: Impacts on the Low Pay Sector: Summary Report Centre for Work + Life, (2007); Elton J., Pocock B., Not fair, no choice.

It is especially aimed at studying the influence of changes in the age composition of the population on this indicator. The main findings are: (a) while the underlying trends for males and females are in the opposite direction, both male and female employment ratios fall in recession and rise in recoveries; (b) changes in the age composition of the population (ageing, per se) can explain only a very small amount of the changes in the aggregate employment ratio for both males and females over the period 1978–2001; (c) the falling aggregate male employment ratio is not primarily or even largely a result of movements out of employment by older workers, indeed, over half of the reduction in the aggregate employment ratio for males is due to falling employment ratios for prime working-age males.

In this contribution, however, we contend that while a traditional macroeconomic perspective goes some way towards explaining the nature of the employment relationship, it fails to acknowledge that commodification is a necessary but not sufficient condition for labour utilisation. Viewed through the lens of organisation theory, the main employer agenda regarding labour utilisation is that of 'human resource' objectification, rather than market commodification. We seek to demonstrate this by examining how, under contemporary 'human resource management' (HRM), labour management theory and practice have developed into a sophisticated project designed to psychologise the employee subject into a resource object. In line with objectification, it is a project through which management seek to render human capabilities, attitudes and emotions - the basis of the worker's status as a social and organisational subject - classifiable, measurable and, hence, more manipulable.","","","Albrecht S., Travaglione A., Trust in public-sector senior management, International Journal of Human Resource Management, 14, 1, pp. 76-92, (2003); Alvesson M., Deetz S., Critical theory and postmodernism: Approaches to organizational studies, Theory and Method, pp. 184-211, (1999); Alvesson M., Karreman D., Varieties of discourse: On the study of organizations through discourse analysis, Human Relations, 53, 9, pp. 1125-1149, (2000); Anderson N., Schalk R., The psychological contract in retrospect and prospect, Journal of Organizational Behavior, 19, pp. 637-647, (1998); Arthur J., Effects of human resource systems on manufacturing performance and turnover, Academy of Management Journal, 37, 3, pp. 670-687, (1994); Ashkanasy N., Daus C., Rumours of the death of emotional intelligence in organizational behaviour are vastly exaggerated, Journal of Organizational Behavior, 26, pp. 441-452, (2005); Barrick M., Mount M., Judge T., Personality and job performance at the beginning of the new millennium: What do we know and where do we go next?, International Journal of Selection and Assessment, 9, pp. 9-30, (2001); Beer M., Spector B., Lawrence P., Quin Mills D., Walton R., Managing Human Management: A General Manager's Perspective, (1985); Beugre C., Managing Fairness in Organizations, (1998); Colquitt J., Greenberg J., Zapata-Phelan C.P., What is organizational justice?

Little attention has been paid to how the number of memberships is affected by common measures of team performance, such as the team's win-ratio. This study utilises a previously unavailable long range timeseries data set of annual memberships for an Australian Football League (AFL) club, Hawthorn FC. A succession of basic correlation analyses demonstrates that, while the relation between club membership numbers and win-ratios is strongly positive as it is for attendances (for most of the sample), some of the finer properties are substantially different. It is suggested that much of the reason for this lies in differences between the segmented nature of these markets for attendances and memberships.","Demand; Markets; Sporting match attendance; Sports club membership; Sports economics","","Booth D.R., The economics of achieving competitive balance in the Australian Football League, 1897-2004, Economic Papers, 23, 4, pp. 325-344, (2004); Borland J., Lye J.N., Attendance at Australian Rules football: A panel study, Applied Economics, 24, 9, pp. 1053-1058, (1992); Borland J., Macdonald R., Demand for sport, Oxford Review of Economic Policy, 19, 4, pp. 478-502, (2003); Butler M.R., Interleague play and baseball attendance, Journal of Sports Economics, 3, 4, pp. 320-334, (2002); DellaVigna S., Malmendier U.M., Paying not to go to the gym, American Economic Review, 96, 3, pp. 694-719, (2006); Fuller P., Stewart M., Attendance patterns at Victorian and South Australian football games, Economic Papers, 15, 1, pp. 83-93, (1996); Funk D.C., James J., A psychological continuum model: A conceptual framework for understanding an individual's connection to sport, Sport Management Review, 4, 2, pp. 119-150, (2001); Gleeson M., Newbold calls for a ""Family fund, The Age, (2011); Gordon H., The Hard Way: The Story of Hawthorn Football Club, (1990); Hyndes M., Smith I., The demand for test match cricket, Applied Economics Letters, 1, 7, pp. 103-106, (1994); Leeds M.A., von Allmen P., The Economics of Sports, (2011); Lenten L.J.A., Unobserved components in competitive balance and match attendances in the Australian Football League, 1945-2005: Where is all the action happening?, Economic Record, 85, 269, pp. 181-196, (2009); Lenten L.J.A., Long-run trends and factors in attendance patterns in sport: Australian Football League, 1945-2009, Handbook on the Economics of Leisure, pp. 360-380, (2011); Linnell G., Football Ltd: The Inside Story of the AFL, (1995); Peel D., Thomas D., Outcome uncertainty and the demand for football: An analysis of match attendances in the English Football League, Scottish Journal of Political Economy, 35, 3, pp. 242-249, (1988); Pinnuck M., Potter B., Impact of on-field football success on the offfield financial performance of AFL football clubs, Accounting and Finance, 46, 3, pp. 499-517, (2006); Shaw R.N., McDonald H., Relating on-field performance to paid football club membership, International Journal of Sports Marketing and Sponsorship, 7, 1, pp. 68-74, (2005); Stewart R.K., The economic development of the Victorian Football League, 1960-1984, Sporting Traditions, 1, 2, pp. 2-26, (1985)","L.

Late nineteenth century migration brought Melanesian migrants to Queensland cane plantations, notably from the New Hebrides (Vanuatu). A century later, early twenty-first century agricultural shortages took migrants from several island states to New Zealand and Australia. Migrants moved from semi-subsistence agricultural systems - where income generation was trivial - in search of incomes, goods and experience(s). Forced migration gave way to conscious choice. Similarities in the organisation of recruitment, acquisition of income and skills and improved material well-being attend both phases. Women have been more likely to participate in the second phase. Overall outcomes have been unequal with the principal gains accrued in destinations rather than by the migrants or their home islands.","","","Adams R., Plantation labour in vanuatu, Labour in the South Pacific, pp. 140-143, (1990); Toward a New Pacific Regionalism, (2005); Temporary Skilled Migration.

In doing so it draws on the experience of player associations in English soccer and American baseball. England's Professional Footballers' Association acted as a beacon to various attempts by Australian soccer players to form associations. Its legal victory in Eastham, in 1963, where it challenged the retain and transfer system, has had a resonance in Australia with the 1971 decision of the High Court in Tutty which struck down the New South Wales Rugby League's retain and transfer system. This and decisions by lower courts in other states aided Australian player associations in their dealings with their respective leagues. Information is provided on various failed beginnings prior to World War I, and subsequent successful attempts to establish player associations in Australia, the formation of confederations both domestic and international, details of the respective membership of associations, the average income of members and a measure of their ability to provide services for members. © 2012, University of New South Wales.

That cost extends to allowing major emitters to make guaranteed windfall profits from pollution permits. The emission trading scheme suffers numerous problems, but the issues raised in this article show that taxes can also be watered down and made ineffectual through concessions. Taxpayers will get no assets from the billions of dollars to be spent buying-off the coal generators or other polluters. The scheme seeks to stimulate private investors to create an additional 12 per cent in renewable electricity generation by 2020. A really serious emissions reducing alternative would need to create a nationalised electricity sector with 100 per cent renewable energy within a decade. We explore the limitations of Australia's carbon tax plan which has now passed into law.","Australia; Carbon taxation; Climate change; Emission trading; Greenhouse gases; Regulation; Renewable energy","","Alexander C., Ross Garnaut savages Government over climate scheme, Herald Sun, (2008);

The TPPA is intended to multilateralise the bilateral legally binding agreements the US has with four of these countries, including Australia, as the building block for a legally binding Free Trade Agreement in the Asia Pacific area. The TPPA re-opens many of the issues debated in the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement in 2004. These include pressures from US industry groups for changes to Australian regulation like the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, regulation and labelling of genetically engineered foods and local content rules for Australian media. The paper analyses the endurance of the agenda despite the changes of government in the US and Australia since 2004, and discusses the contradictions and uncertainties of the strategy in Australia and in the Asia Pacific.","Australia-US free trade agreement (AUSFTA); Bilateral trade agreements; Trans pacific partnership agreement (TPPA); United states trade policy","","Alwyn J., The TPPA and Indigenous Peoples: Lessons from Latin America, pp. 70-81, (2010); (2010); (2002); Australian Broadcasting Corporation Radio National, (2003); Fears New Regional Trade Deal to Undermine Public Interest, PM Programme, (2010); Bilaterals Don't Work, Transcript of PM Programme, (2010); Bitter Pill?'

Financial literacy is crucial for young adults as they embark on life events involving major expenditure and debt, particularly for university students who have already accrued a debt based on Higher Education contribution scheme liability and who are making labour market decisions. This paper investigates the determining factors of personal financial literacy levels among a sample of university students at different stages of study and across diverse study areas including business, education, arts, humanities and the sciences; with some interesting findings for policy makers. It also provides indicative evidence of students' preferred method of learning more about personal finance to facilitate the effective design of personal financial literacy programs.","Financial education; Financial literacy; Life-cycle income; University students","","ANZ Survey of Adult Financial Literacy in Australia 2005, (2005); Beal D., Delpachitra S., Financial literacy among Australian University students, Economic Papers, 22, 1, pp. 65-78, (2003); Chatzky J., Teach our children well, Money, 31, 7, (2002); Chen H., Volpe R., An analysis of personal financial literacy among college students, Financial Services Review, 7, 2, pp. 107-128, (1998); de Bruin W., Vanderklaauw W., Downs J., Fischhoff B., Topa G., Armantier O., Expectations of inflation: The role of demographic variables, expectation formation, and financial literacy, Journal of Consumer Affairs, 44, 2, pp. 381-482, (2010); Fama E., Efficient capital markets: A review of theory and empirical work, Journal of Finance, 25, 2, pp. 383-417, (1970); Fear J., O'Brien J., Where does the buck stop?

We then explore the AFL data from 2001-2009 and show that the declining share of player salaries as a proportion of revenue is consistent with the predictions from these theoretical models. This poses the question of what the league and the clubs do with the additional revenue if they are not paying it to the players.

For events, we consider the presence of Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association, National Football League and National Hockey League franchises as well as whether a city held one of the respective championships, the Olympics, or World Cup matches. We find little to no evidence that sporting events or franchises are correlated with changes in either property or violent crime with two notable exceptions. The Olympics Games are associated with roughly a 10 per cent increase in property crimes while the Super Bowl is associated with a 2.5 per cent decrease in violent crime. On the whole, however, the presence of spectator sports does not seem to automatically carry with it any improvements in citywide criminal behaviour.","Crime; Sports economics","","Arellano M., Bond S., Some tests of specification for panel data: Monte Carlo evidence and an application to employment equations, Review of Economic Studies, 58, 2, pp. 277-297, (1991); Atkinson G., Mourato S., Szymanski S., Ozdemiroglu E., Are we willing to pay enough to ""back the bid""?: Valuing the intangible impacts of London's bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympic Games, Urban Studies, 45, 2, pp. 419-444, (2008); Baade R., Matheson V., Bidding for the Olympics: Fool's gold?, Transatlantic Sport: The Comparative Economics of North American and European Sports, pp. 127-151, (2002); Baade R., Baumann R., Matheson V., Selling the game: Estimating the economic impact of professional sports through taxable sales, Southern Economic Journal, 74, 3, pp. 794-810, (2008); Baumann R., Matheson V., Muroi C., Bowling in Hawaii: Examining the effectiveness of sports-based tourism strategies, Journal of Sports Economics, 10, 1, pp. 107-123, (2009); Becker G., Crime and punishment: An economic approach, Journal of Political Economy, 76, pp. 169-217, (1968); Bond S., Dynamic panel data models: A guide to micro data methods and practice, Portuguese Economic Journal, 1, pp. 141-162, (2002); Carlino G., Coulson E., Compensating differentials and the social benefits of the NFL, Journal of Urban Economics, 56, 1, pp. 25-50, (2004); Card D., Dahl G., Family violence and football: The effect of unexpected emotional cues on violent behavior, (2009); Coates D., Humphreys B., The economic impact of post-season play in professional sports, Journal of Sports Economics, 3, 3, pp. 291-299, (2002); Coates D., Matheson V., Mega-events and housing costs: Raising the rent while raising the roof?, Annals of Regional Science, 46, 1, pp. 119-137, (2011); Cohen M., Pain, suffering, and jury awards: A study of the cost of crime to victims, Law and Society Review', 22, 3, pp. 537-556, (1988); Dehring C., Depken C., Ward M., The impact of stadium announcements on residential property values: Evidence from a natural experiment in Dallas-Ft.

Following an examination of the origins and impact of this principle on ILO and United Nations (UN) conventions relating to migrant workers, the paper examines how Australia has responded to such conventions. In this regard, the paper highlights the counterveiling influence of the neoclassical economic perspective on the way migrant workers in Australia have been treated and represented from the post-war period until recent times as either factory fodder' and/or 'business assets'. Both representations, we argue, treat migrants as commodities. To challenge this approach the paper identifies how migrant workers have distinguished themselves from commodities through resistance to poor working conditions and also management strategies that treat them as if they were commodities.","","","Public Transport Commission of NSW and Australian Railways Union, (1981); Alcorso C., Women, work and cultural diversity in the 1990s, Proceedings, 1995 Global Cultural Diversity Conference, (1995); Labour not a commodity, New York Times, (1916); Bacchi C., The seesaw effect: Down goes affirmative action, up comes workplace diversity, Journal of Interdisciplinary Gender Studies, 5, 2, pp. 64-83, (2000); Bernard J.R.L., The Macquarie Thesaurus, (1992); Bertone S., Productive diversity in australia - Bureaucratic aspirations versus workplace realities, Proceedings of the International Conference: Culture, Race and Community: Making It Work in the New Millennium, (1999); Bertone S., From Factory Fodder to Multicultural Mediators: A Typology of NESB Immigrant Work Experiences in Australia, (2004); Besser L., Whistleblower's life in ruins, Sydney Morning Herald, (2008); Borjas G.J., Triends or Strangers: The Impact of Immigrants on the U.S. Economy, (1990); Butler-Bowden E., The Service?

I concentrate on the assistance given to emissions-intensive, tradeexposed industries and use a post Keynesian approach to explain that, despite the rhetoric, industries and firms will not move offshore under a carbon price and industry assistance is unnecessary. When assistance is given, profits are protected and could increase in certain industries, which occurred in the comparable European emissions trading scheme. In orthodox economic theory, despite this negligible impact on profits, any method of pricing carbon causes a reduction in emissions because firms seek to adjust technology and factor inputs at the margin and abate until marginal abatement costs equal the carbon price. However, from a post Keynesian perspective, the government's prediction of a transformed economy and clean energy future will not occur unless the carbon pricing policy reduces the corporate profits of emitting firms. Thus, complementary policies are required to take the burden of reducing emissions off the more symbolic carbon market established. I further argue that a carbon tax without any industry assistance is a preferred approach and that where plant shutdown does occur, carbon emissions around the world will fall and workers could be compensated at a far smaller cost than the adjustment assistance given to industries in the policy's current form.","Carbon price; Industry assistance; Kalecki; Mark-up pricing; Post keynesian economics; Profits; Salter","","Annual Report: 2010, (2010); Media Release: Government Issues a Major ThRET to Australia's Aluminium Industry, (2009); Asimakopulos A., A Kaleckian theory of income distribution, Canadian Journal of Economics, 8, (1988); Blecker R.A., Kaleckian macro models for open economies, Foundations of International Economics: Post Keynesian Perspectives, pp. 116-149, (1999); Bloch H., Steindl's contribution to the theory of industry concentration, Australian Economic Papers, 92, pp. 92-107, (2000); Bloch H., Steindl on imperfect competition: The role of technical change, Metroeconomica, 57, 3, pp. 286-302, (2006); Chapman B., Lounkaew K., How many jobs is 23,510, really?

The Work Choices amendments introduce significant changes to agreement-making. The most significant of these changes are the abolition of the no-disadvantage test, the effect of termination of agreements, and the new ‘safety net’ provided by the Fair Pay and Conditions Standard. Employers have welcomed these changes as a step closer to a system of common law regulation of the employment relationship. However, for employees, the simplification of the approval process and the removal of the vetting of Australian Workplace Agreements (AWAs), may expose them to AWAs which contain low wages and very limited conditions of employment. How far down this path some employers will attempt to go is yet unknown but it is clear that for some AWA employees, there will be considerable detriment to their working conditions and entitlements. © 2006, University of New South Wales.

The primary objective of these policies has been to enhance wealth and prosperity by improving productivity and flexibility of the workforce and competition and accountability in the market. Yet the evidence suggests that precarious workers are not benefiting from this increased prosperity, indeed they suffer by comparison with all other workers. Cleaners are a subset of precarious workers who have been hard hit by the dual impacts of labour market decentralisation and privatisation. This study finds quantitative evidence of an increasing gap in earnings between cleaners and other workers in Australia since the onset of workplace relations decentralization and the proliferation of privatisation in the mid 1990s. We locate our argument in recent debates about the nature of variegated neoliberalism, the emergence of the networked economy, and the implications of these developments for the nature of work and employment.","Cleaners; Income disparity; Low-paid workers; Networked economy; Outsourcing; Precarious work; Privatisation and decentralisation; Vulnerable","","Employee Earnings and Hours, (1996); Labour Force, Australia, (1996); Employee Earnings and Hours, (1998); Employee Earnings and Hours, (2000); Australian Bureau of Statistics, Cleaning Services Industry, (2000); 2001 Census Tables: Australia, Occupation Code 9111-11 By Industry Division L7866, (2001); Employee Earnings and Hours, (2002); Employee Earnings and Hours, (2004); Employee Earnings and Hours, (2006); Employee Earnings and Hours, (2008); Employee Earnings and Hours, (2010); Labour Force, Australia, (2010); Consumer Price Index Australia, (2010); Adams D., Hess M., Alternatives to competitive tendering and privatisation: A case study from the Australian health industry, Australian Journal of Public Administration, 59, 1, pp. 49-59, (2000); Alcorso C., Improving occupational health and safety information to immigrant workers in NSW, (2002); Atkinson A., Leigh A., The distribution of top incomes in Australia, Top Incomes Over the Twentieth Century: A Contrast Between Continental European and English-Speaking Countries, pp. 309-332, (2007); Baird M., Cooper R., Ellem B., Low-paid women: The impact of regulatory change in Australia, Industrial Relations Journal, 40, 5, pp. 393-407, (2009); Boushey H., Fremstad S., The wages of exclusion: Low-page work and inequality, New Labor Forum, 17, 2, pp. 9-19, (2008); Bray M., Underhill E., Industry differences in the neoliberal transformation of Australian industrial relations, Industrial Relations Journal, 40, 5, pp. 372-392, (2009); Brenner N., Peck J., Theodore N., Variegated neoliberalization: Geographies, modalities, pathways, Global Networks, 10, 2, pp. 1-41, (2010); Brosnan P., Walsh P., Employment security in Australia and New Zealand, Labour and Industry, 8, 3, pp. 23-42, (1998); Burgess J., Campbell I., The nature and dimensions of precarious employment in Australia, Labour and Industry, 8, 3, pp. 5-22, (1998); Castells M., The Rise of the Network Society, (1996); Creswell J.W., Research Design: Qualitative, Quantitative and Mixed Methods Approaches, (2009); de Man A.-P., The Network Economy: Strategy, Structure and Management, (2004); Dimaggio P., Introduction, The Twenty First Century Firm: Changing Economic Organization in International Perspective, pp. 3-30, (2001); Elton J., Pocock B., The effects of WorkChoices on vulnerable South Australian workers and their households, Labour and Industry, 18, 3, pp. 93-114, (2008); Flecker J., Outsourcing spatial relocation and the fragmentation of employment, Competition and Change, 13, 3, pp. 251-266, (2009); Flecker J., Organisational restructuring, employment relations and the dynamics of national regulatory frameworks, Work Organisation, Labour and Globalisation, 4, 1, pp. 8-23, (2010); Flecker J., Holtgrewe U., Schonauer A., Dunkel W., Meil P., Restructuring Across Value Chains and Changes in Work and Employment: Case Study Evidence from the Clothing, Food, it And Public Sector, (2007); Flecker J., Meil P., Organisational restructuring and emerging service value chains, Work, Employment and Society, 24, 4, pp. 680-698, (2010); Fraser L., Impact of Contracting Out on Female NESB Workers: Case Study of the NSW Government Cleaning Service, (1997); Fair Work Ombudsman, National Cleaning Services Campaign 2010-11, (2011); Grimshaw D., Marchington M., Rubery J., Willmott H., Introduction: Fragmenting work across organizational boundaries, Fragmenting Work: Blurring Organizational Boundaries and Disordering Hierarchies, pp. 1-38, (2005); Grugulis I., Vincent S., Hebson G., The rise of the ""network organisation"" and the decline of discretion, Human Resource Management Journal, 13, 2, pp. 45-59, (2003); Herod A., Aguiar L., Introduction: Cleaners and the dirty work of neoliberalism, Antipode, 38, 3, pp. 425-434, (2006); The Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia, (2006); Hyman R., The state in industrial relations, The Sage Handbook of Industrial Relations, pp. 12-37, (2008); Industry Report for Cleaning Services in Australia, (2004); Cleaning Services in Australia, (2010); Johnstone R., Mayhew C., Quinlan M., Outsourcing risk?

The lowest level of unemployment in the last twenty years was double that and long term unemployment, virtually unknown in the 1950s and 1960s, has been a severe problem. In each period there were two major slumps. We examine the progress of each slump and macroeconomic policy responses in each case, in order to search for reasons for this contrast. The priority given to minimising unemployment rather than restraining inflation is the most important difference between the two periods. Other major principles stand out, the most important of which are that in response to a downturn a fiscal policy stimulus is essential and must play the major part of any response; and that implementation must be swift and then followed up by further measures if necessary.","Economic recovery; Economic slump; Economic stimulus policy; Fiscal policy; Full employment; Inflation; Macroeconomic policy","","Quarterly Summary of Australian Statistics, (1950); Monthly Review of Business Statistics, (1950); Consumer Price Index, (1972); Year Book Australia (earlier Official Yearbook of the Commonwealth of Australia), (1945); Labour Force Australia, Australian System of National Accounts, (1978); Australian National Accounts: National Income, Expenditure and Product, (1992); Barro R., Inflation and growth, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review, (1996); The Coming of Keynesianism to America: Conversations with the Founders of Keynesian Economics, (1996); White Paper on Full Employment, (1945); Annual Report, (1950); Crosby M., Milbourne R., Money and monetary policy, The Australian Economy, Third Edition, pp. 113-128, (1999); Ericsson N., Irons J., Tryon R., Output and inflation in the long run, Journal of Applied Econometrics, 16, pp. 241-253, (2001); Fraser B., Reserve bank independence, Reserve Bank of Austgralia Bulletin, pp. 14-20, (1996); Furceri D., Mourougane A., The effect of financial crises on potential output: New empirical evidence from OECD ountries, OECD Economics Department Working Papers, 669, (2009); Foster R., Stewart S., Australian Economic Statistics, 8, (1991); Gruen D., The Return of Fiscal Policy, (2009); Junor B., Inflation, The Australian Economy, pp. 36-60, (1995); Kim C.-J., Morley J., Piger J., Nonlinearity and the permanent effects of recessions, Journal of Applied Econometrics, 20, pp. 291-309, (2005); Kriesler P., Halevi J., Corporatism in Australia, The Political Economy of Full Employment, pp. 217-237, (1995); Kriesler P., Halevi J., Australia deconstructed, Journal of Australian Political Economy, 32, pp. 106-121, (1997); Kriesler P., Lavoie M., View of monetary policy, Economic and Labour Relations Review, 16, pp. 7-15, (2005); Kriesler P., Lavoie M., The new consensus on monetary policy and its post-Keynesian critique, Review of Political Economy, 19, 3, pp. 387-404, (2007); Krugman P., How did economists get it so wrong, New York Times Magazine, (2009); Kryger T., Australia""s Foreign Debt, 3, (2003); Kyriakopoulos J., Does moderate inflation affect economic growth, Contemporary Issues in Australian Economics, pp. 49-60, (1991); Minsky H., The financial instability hypothesis: A restatement, Post-Keynesian Economic Theory, pp. 24-56, (1985); Nevile J.W., Fiscal policy sixty years after Keynes, The Australian Economy, pp. 93-112, (1999); OECD Economic Outlook, (2009); Annual Report, (1960)","","","SAGE Publications Ltd","10353046","","","","English","Econ.

India has been a major recipient of such off-shored work. To understand the effects of this phenomenon on off-shore workers, it is necessary to understand the legal context within which such work is undertaken. This article thus explains the labour law framework of India, from Constitutional protections down to local laws, policies and rules. It then examines labour practices, and identifies the gaps between formal labour law and actual practice in this sector. The article notes that some of these gaps between law and practice are a result of public matters, such as corruption, legal exemptions, and lack of law enforcement; but others are due to features of the sector itself, such as its newness, the types of work it offers, and the ready availability of alternative jobs.","","","India 's BPOs in trouble, The Age, (2004); Ahsan A., Labour regulations in India: Impact and policy reform options, SASPR, World Bank, India, presentation to Presentation to Human Development Network, (2006); Basu I., India 's call centers hit mid-life crisis, Asia Times, (2006); Batt R., Doellgast V., Kwon H., Et al., The Indian call centre industry: National benchmarking report strategy, HR practices, and performance, (2005); Bi-national perspective on off-shore outsourcing: A collaboration between Indian and US labour, (2006); India Corruption Study 2005 to Improve Governance, 1, (2005); Chatterjee S.R., Human resource management in India: ""Where from"" and ""where to?, Research and Practice in Human Resource Management, 15, 2, pp. 92-103, (2007); Uttar Pradesh Information and Technology Policy, (2004); Information Technology policy, (2003); State Government of Karnataka (n.d.), Millenium BPO Policy; Farrell D., Laboissiere M., Pascal R., Et al., The emerging global labor market: Part 1- the demand for offshore talent in services, (2005); Gentleman A., The painful truth of the call centre cyber coolie, The Guardian, (2005); Policy on Information Technology Enabled Services, (2002); With J., India J.N.D., Collaboration, Global Justice; Mayo S.A., Comments delivered by Stephen A, Mayo, Executive Director, ISDLS, High Court of Karnataka mediation programme, (2007); Government of India N.D., India and the ILO; The NASSCOM ITES-BPO summit 2007: Outlining a roadmap for the future, BPO Newsline, (2007); Penfold C., Trade union responses to white-collar off-shoring, Economic and Labour Relations Review, 18, 1, pp. 53-77, (2007); Penfold C., Off-shoring and decent work: Worlds apart?, International Journal of Comparative Labour Law and Industrial Relations, 24, 4, pp. 573-594, (2008); Pradhan J.P., Abraham V., Social and cultural impact of outsourcing: Emerging issues from Indian call centres, Harvard Asia Quarterly, 9, 3, pp. 22-30, (2005); Ramesh B.P., Labour in Business Process Outsourcing: A Case Study of Call-Centre Agents, 5, (2004); Roy A.S., IT industry slams CITU move to form association, The Hindu Business Line Internet, (2006); Sasikumar S.K., Varma U.K., Information and Communication Technology and Decent Work: Study of India 's Experience, 5, (2004); Stone K.V.W., Legal regulation of the [changing] employment contract, Cornell Journal of Law and Public Policy, 13, pp. 563-579, (2004); Taylor P., Bain P., An assembly line in the head: Work and employee relations in the call centre, Industrial Relations Journal, 30, 2, pp. 101-117, (1999); Taylor P., Bain P., Entrapped by the ""electronic panopticon""?

This article focuses on governance of sporting organisations in Australia. Sport in Australia is organised in a singular fashion when compared to other organisations and to sport in other countries. This has significant implications for assumptions about corporate structure, law and governance. The article examines governance of sporting organisations from a number of perspectives and draws distinctions between standard assumptions about governance and the realities of sports governance in Australia. It concludes that a number of assumptions made about organisations in law and governance theory do not apply to Australian sporting organisations. It asks how these anomalies in assumption and execution affect ultimate good governance in sport and impact on the way directors approach their duties. © 2012, University of New South Wales.

At the time of the study, garment manufacturers in Sri Lanka faced increased pressure from international buyers to improve product quality and to meet stringent production delivery schedules, along with growing concerns from Western consumers regarding factory conditions and labour standards. One outcome of these pressures was increased experimentation with a range of quality management techniques to elicit workforce commitment to improved efficiency levels and higher quality standards. This study documents one experiment whereby production line operators rotated the role of production supervisor amongst themselves and accepted responsibility for minimising production bottlenecks, and for communicating data on workplace efficiency, product reject rates and absenteeism levels to other line operators. We found that workplace productivity and product quality increased over the 18-month period of the study, while levels of labour turnover and absenteeism declined. Nevertheless, the study also found that the increased role in workplace decision-making provided to employees also came with increased expectations that line employees would achieve higher production targets, improve quality and monitor workplace attendance.","","","Akuratiyagamage V.M., Identification of management development needs: A comparison across companies of different ownership- foreign, joint venture and local in Sri Lanka, International Journal of Human Resource Management, 16, 8, pp. 1512-1528, (2005); Allan C., Lovell K., The effects of high performance work systems on employees in aged care, Labour and Industry, 13, 3, pp. 1-17, (2003); Appelbaum E., Batt R., The New American Workplace, (1994); Appelbaum E., Bailey T., Berg P., Kalleberg A., Manufacturing Advantage: Why High Performance Work Systems Pay Off, (2000); Barker J., Tightening the iron cage: Concertive control in self-managing teams, Administrative Science Quarterly, 38, 3, pp. 408-437, (1993); An Overview of Textile and Apparel Sector, Annual report, Board of Investment of Sri Lanka, Columbo, (2001); Boxall P., Purcell J., Strategy and Human Resource Management, (2003); Bank C., Future Challenges of the Apparel Industry, Central Bank Annual Report, (2001); Central Bank of Sri Lanka, (2002); Danford A., Workers, unions and the high performance workplace, Work, Employment and Society, 17, 3, pp. 569-573, (2003); Douglas C., Gardner W., Transition to self-directed work teams: Implications of transition time and self-monitoring for managers ' use of influence tactics , Journal of Organisational Behavior, 25, pp. 47-65, (2004); Edwards R., Contested Terrain: The Transformation of the Workplace in the Twentieth Century, (1979); Third party complaint regarding a facility contracted by Nike in Sri Lanka, (2004); Fox A., Beyond Contract: Work, Power and Trust Relations, (1974); Godard J., A critical assessment of the high-performance paradigm, British Journal of Industrial Relations, 42, pp. 349-378, (2004); Godard J., Delaney J., Reflections on the ""high performance"" paradigm 's implications for industrial relations as a field , Industrial and Labor Relations Review, 53, 3, pp. 482-502, (2000); Guthrie J., High-involvement work practices, turnover and productivity: Evidence from New Zealand, Academy of Management Journal, 44, 1, pp. 180-190, (2001); Hackman J.R., Oldham G.R., Development of the job diagnostic survey, Journal of Applied Psychology, 60, pp. 159-170, (1975); Hackman J.R., Oldham G.R., Janson R., Purdy K., A new strategy for job enrichment, California Management Review, pp. 57-71, (1975); Hales C., Management and empowerment programmes, Work, Employment and Society, 14, 3, pp. 501-519, (2000); Harley B., Team membership and the experience of work in Britain: An analysis of the WERS98 data, Work Employment and Society, 15, 4, pp. 721-742, (2001); Ichniowski C., Kochan T., Levine D., Olson C., Strauss G., What works at work: Overview and assessment, Industrial Relations, 35, 3, pp. 299-333, (1996); Sri Lanka: State of the Economy- 2003, (1998); Jayawardana A.K.L., Fonseka T., Self managed teams and organisational performance: Experience of Asian Cotton Mills Ltd., Sri Lanka, Sri Lankan Journal of Management, 1, pp. 375-399, (1996); Kelegama S., Epparachchi R., Productivity, Competitiveness and Job Quality in the Garment Industry in Sri Lanka, (2002); Konovsky M.A., Pugh S.D., Citizenship behavior and social exchange, Academy of Management Journal, 37, pp. 656-669, (1994); Krueger R.A., Focus Groups: A Practical Guide for Applied Research, (1994); Patterson M.G., West M.A., Wall T.D., Integrated manufacturing, empowerment, and company performance, Journal of Organizational Behavior, 25, pp. 641-665, (2004); Richardson H.A., Vandenberg R.J., Integrating managerial perceptions and transformational leadership into a work-unit level model of employee involvement, Journal of Organizational Behavior, 26, pp. 561-589, (2005); Robinson S.L., Trust and breach of the psychological contract, Administrative Science Quarterly, 41, pp. 574-599, (1996); Rosa K., The conditions and organizational activities of women in Free Trade Zones, Malaysia, Philippines and Sri Lanka, Dignity and Daily Bread: New Forms of Economic Organizing Among Poor Women in the Third World, pp. 1970-1990, (1994); Stake R.E., Case studies, Handbook of Qualitative Research, pp. 435-449, (2000); Spence Laschinger H.K., Finegan J.E., Shamian J., Wilk P., A longitudinal analysis of the impact of workplace empowerment on work satisfaction, Journal of Organizational Behavior, 25, pp. 527-545, (2004); Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission, (1999); Yin R., Case Study Research: Design and Methods, (2003); Zand D.E., Trust and managerial problem solving, Administrative Science Quarterly, 17, pp. 229-247, (1972)","","","SAGE Publications Ltd","10353046","","","","English","Econ.

Since the reforms of the 1980s, industry policy has been characterised by an economic liberal approach, the purity of which has been compromised by political pragmatism - particularly evident in the continued support for the auto industry. This article examines the issues raised by industry policy, and the history of industry policy in Australia, as a context for a review of a Report recently released by the Non-Governmental Members of the Prime Minister's Task Force on Manufacturing. This review finds useful proposals within the document, as well as a strong statement of the need for interventionist policy, albeit buried in the main text and an appendix. That this discussion is not front and centre in the Report's presentation indicates ongoing sensitivity about the main choice in industry policy - whether the government should selectively intervene, or leave the organisation of industry to the market. © 2012, The Economic and Labour Relations Review.","Australian industry policy; Economic intervention; Industry policy","","ACTU/TDC, Australian council of trade unions/Trade development council secretariat, Australia Reconstructed, (1987); Bell S., State strength and state weakness: Manufacturing industry and the post-war Australian state, State, Economy and Public Policy in Australia, (1994); Bello W., Rosenfeld S., Dragons in Distress: Asia's Miracle Economies in Crisis, (1990); Block F., Inside views: US industrial policies, R&D, and the WTO's definition of non-actionable subsidies, Intellectual Property Watch, (2010); Capling A., Galligan B., Beyond the Protective State: The Political Economy of Australia's Manufacturing Industry Policy, (1992); Castles F., Australian Public Policy and Economic Vulnerability, (1988); Conley T., Van Acker E., Whatever happened to industry policy in Australia?, Australian Journal of Political Science, 46, 3, pp. 503-517, (2011); Building A Competitive Australia, (1991); Dertouzos M., Lester R., Solow R., Made in America - Regaining the Competitive Edge, (1989); Deyo F., Beneath the Miracle: Labor Subordination in the New Asian Industrialism, (1989); The global revival of industrial policy: Picking winners, saving losers, Economist, (2010); Ewer P., Higgins W., Industry policy under the Accord: Reform vs traditionalism in economic management, Politics, 21, 1, pp. 28-39, (1986); Ewer P., Higgins W., Stephens A., The Unions and the Future of Australian Manufacturing, (1987); Ewer P., Hampson I., Lloyd C., Rainford J., Rix S., Smith M., Politics and the Accord, (1991); Garnaut R., Australia and the North-East Asian Ascendancy, (1989); Hampson I., Post-Fordism and the Politics of Industry Development in Australia, (1994); Hampson I., The Accord: A post-mortem, Labour and Industry, 7, 2, pp. 55-77, (1996); Hall P., Soskice D., Varieties of Capitalism: The Institutional Foundations of Comparative Advantage, (2001); Hayes R., Abernathy W., Managing our way to economic decline, Harvard Business Review, 58, 4, pp. 67-77, (1980); Hayes R., Wheelwright S., Restoring Our Competitive Edge: Competing Through Manufacturing, (1984); Hirst P., Zeitlin J., Flexible specialisation versus Post-Fordism: Theory, evidence and policy implications, Economy and Society, 20, 1, pp. 1-56, (1991); Johnson C., MITI and the Japanese Miracle: The Growth of Industrial Policy, 1925-75, (1982); Johnson C., Political institutions and economic performance: The government-business relationship in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, The Political Economy of the New Asian Industrialisation, (1987); Jones E., The evolution of industry policy under Howard, Australian Review of Public Affairs, (2006); Katzenstein P., Between Power and Plenty: Foreign Economic Policies of Advanced Industrial Societies, (1978); Katzenstein P., Small States in World Markets, (1985); Lall S., Reinventing industrial strategy: The role of government policy in building industrial competitiveness, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development; Intergovernmental Group of Twenty-Four; Research Papers for the Intergovernmental Group of Twenty-Four on International Monetary Affairs, (2004); Linden G., China standard time: A study in strategic industrial policy, Business and Politics, 6, 3, pp. 1-26, (2004); McKay D., Grant W., Industrial policies in O.E.C.D.

Despite attempts to rectify the situation (with Victorian common rule awards), issues of coverage and employer compliance remained. The implementation of WorkChoices legislation in 2006 posed a further challenge to Victorian low-paid workers. Our research found that the impact of WorkChoices on the Victorian low-paid has been largely insidious, surfacing primarily as an increased wage-effort ratio, with people working more unpaid hours and at an increased pace. The implications of this are that these hidden effects are more likely to linger, even with the replacement of WorkChoices with the Fair Work Act, 2009. Furthermore, it appears that employer compliance with minimum conditions requires more adequate enforcement by the Federal Government.","Labour market regulation; Low-paid workers; Workers' rights; Working conditions","","AIRC Safety Net Wage Decision, (2001); Employee Earnings and Hours, Australia, (2006); National Regional Profile, Victoria, 2005-2009, November.

Since the mid-1970s there has been renewed interest in, and reinterpretation of, Smith's work. This paper looks at two aspects of this reinterpretation, the first of which is Smith's writing on wages. Smith was an advocate of high wages, a view that strongly contrasted with the received wisdom of the day. He considered that a wage which provided for a reasonable standard of living was essential for the development of an economy. The second aspect encompasses Smith's notion of the subsistence wage which traces its historic lineage to the Greek philosophers. The paper concludes that Smith, the champion of 'liberty' and non-government interference in markets, would probably have supported the notion of minimum wages, such as are now mandated in the United Kingdom, the United States and Australia. Nevertheless, the mandating of minimum wages is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the achievement of living wage outcomes.","Economics; Living wage; Minimum wage; Moral sentiment; Wage principles","","Becker G., The Economic Approach to Human Behavior, (1976); Billet L., The just economy: The moral basis of the wealth of nations, Review of Social Economy, 34, 3, pp. 295-315, (1976); Bretano L., Hours and Wages in Relation to Production, (1894); Brown W., The operations of the low pay commission, Employee Relations, 24, 6, pp. 595-605, (2002); Burke E., Thoughts and Details on Scarcity, (1800); Buss J., Franceschi D., Employment trends in some American cities with living wage ordinances, Local Economy, 18, 3, pp. 208-221, (2003); Campbell R., Evidence to the Royal Commission on Child Endowment or Family Allowances, (1929); Clary B.J., Smith and living wages, The American Journal of Economics and Sociology, 68, 5, pp. 1063-1084, (2009); Danner P.L., Sympathy and exchange value: Keys to Adam Smith's social philosophy, Review of Social Economy, 34, 3, pp. 317-331, (1976); Dempsey B.W., Just prices in a functioning economy, Economic Thought: Historical Anthology, pp. 4-23, (1965); Dengate R., Adam Smith: Architect of a Flawed System or Ignored Prophet, (2010); Evensky J., Adam Smith's Moral Philosophy: A Historical and Contemporary Perspectives on Markets, Law, Ethics and Culture, (2005); Fleischacker S., On Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations, (2004); Haakonssen K., Winch D., The legacy of Adam Smith, The Cambridge Companion to Adam Smith, pp. 366-394, (2006); Heilbroner R.L., The Essential Adam Smith, (1986); International labour organisation, Minimum Wage Fixing Convention, (1970); Irvine W.B., The other side of Adam Smith, The Freeman, 40, 2, (1990); Isaac J., Macintyre S., Introduction, The New Province for Law and Order: 100 Years of Australian Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration, pp. 1-17, (2004); Levin-Waldman O.M., Minimum wage and justice?, Review of Social Economy, 53, 1, pp. 43-61, (2000); Levin-Waldman, The Case of the Minimum Wage: Competing Models, (2004); Mandeville B., An essay on charity and the charity-schools, The Fable of the Bees Or Private Vices, Publick Benefits, (1924); May R., The British low pay commission and the proposed australian fair pay commission, Journal of Political Economy, 56, pp. 92-104, (2005); Mehta P.B., Self-interest and other interests, The Cambridge Companion to Adam Smith, pp. 246-269, (2006); Miller J.A., Leaving the sphere of exchange with David Houston, Karl Marx, and even Adam Smith: Insights into the debate about sweatshops, Review of Radical Political Economics, 41, 3, pp. 358-364, (2009); Morrow G., The Ethical and Economic Theories of Adam Smith, (1923); Noel E.S., Smith and a living wage: Competition, economic compulsion, and the scholastic legacy, History of Political Economy, 38, 1, pp. 151-174, (2006); Plowman D.H., Protecting the low income earner: Minimum wage determination in Australia, The Economic and Labour Relations Review, 6, 2, pp. 252-287, (1995); Rimlinger G.V., Smith and the merits of the poor, Review of Social Economy, 34, 3, pp. 333-344, (1976); Rothschild E., Adam Smith, Condorcet, and the Enlightenment, (2001); Sen A., Moral codes and economic success, Market Capitalism and Moral Codes: Proceedings of Section F (Economics) of the British Association for the Advancement of Sciences, pp. 23-34, (1995); Smith A., The Theory of Moral Sentiment, (1759); Smith A., An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, (1776); Smith A., Lectures on Jurisprudence, (1976); Stabile D.R., Adam Smith and the natural wage: Sympathy, subsistence and social distance, Review of Social Economy, 55, 3, pp. 292-311, (1997); Stabile D.R., The Living Wage: Lessons from the History of Economic Thought, (2008); Stein H., Remembering Adam Smith, The Wall Street Journal, (1994); Stigler G., Smith's travels on the ship of state, Essays on Adam Smith, pp. 237-246, (1975); Stigler G., The successes and failures of professor Smith, Journal of Political Economy, 84, 6, pp. 1199-1213, (1976); Webb B., Diary July 30, (1886); Webb S., Webb B., The History of Trade Unionism, (1902); Wight J.B., Adam Smith's ethics and the ""noble arts, , Review of Social Economy, 64, 2, pp. 155-179, (2006); Young J.T., The impartial spectator and natural jurisprudence: An interpretation of Adam Smith's theory of the natural price, History of Political Economy, 12, 6-7, pp. 118-133, (1986)","D.

While most approaches stress technological solutions, scholars and policy-makers tend to overlook economics, labour market issues, and industrial relations. Applying agency theory from behavioural economics, this article analyses threats to the US supply chain and opportunities for efficient solutions. Using data from a sophisticated web-based survey of owner-operator cost-of-operations, it shows that drayage1 drivers are among the lowest paid truck drivers and workers in the US. We provide evidence that low pay is associated with both safety and security risk. Low-wage labour and subcontracting present challenges to US and foreign supply-chain security because the market attracts workers who have few other employment options. In this environment, principals and agents currently make inefficient and inequitable contracts because markets do not reflect the complete costs associated with low-probability/high-impact events like cargo theft and transport security.","Agency theory; Compensation; Industrial relations; Labour markets; Owner-operators; Pay rates; Principal-agent models; Security; Supply chain; Terrorism","","Mesaba unions approve new contracts, New York Times, (2006); Safe Rates, Safe Roads, (2010); Somalia's pirates face battles at sea, BBC News, (2008); Somali pirates ""seize cargo ship, BBC News, (2008); Pirates capture Saudi oil tanker, BBC News, (2008); Becker M.A., The shifting public order of the oceans: Freedom of navigation and the interdiction of ships at sea, Harvard International Law Journal, 46, 1, pp. 131-230, (2005); Belman D.L., Monaco K.A., The effects of deregulation, de-unionisation, technology, and human capital on the work and work lives of truck drivers, Industrial and Labor Relations Review, 54, 2 A, pp. 502-524, (2001); Belzer M.H., Collective bargaining after deregulation: Do the Teamsters still count?, Industrial and Labor Relations Review, 48, 4, pp. 636-655, (1995); Belzer M.H., Sweatshops on Wheels: Winners and Losers in Trucking Deregulation, (2000); Belzer M.H., Truck driver security issues: The new world of secure surface transportation, Perspectives on Work, 6, 1, pp. 13-15, (2002); Belzer M.H., OOIDA 2003-2004 Cost of Operations Survey: Report of Results, 5, (2006); Belzer M.H., Burks S.V., Dowell M.S., Swan P.F., Less-than-truckload trucking industry case study and benchmarking report, (2000); Belzer M.H., Rodriguez D.A., Sedo S.A., Paying for Safety: An Economic Analysis of the Effect of Compensation on Truck Driver Safety, (2002); Bloom M., The performance effects of pay dispersion on individuals and organizations, Academy of Management Journal, 42, 1, pp. 25-40, (1999); Bloom M., Milkovich G.T., Relationships among risk, incentive pay, and organizational performance, Academy of Management Journal, 41, 3, pp. 283-297, (1998); Burks S.V., Belzer M.H., Kwan Q., Pratt S.G., Shackelford S., Trucking 101: An Industry Primer, (2010); Cappelli P., Chauvin K., An interplant test of the efficiency wage hypothesis, The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 106, 3, pp. 769-787, (1991); Chapman P.K., Trouble on Board: The Plight of International Seafarers, (1992); Chinoy E., The tradition of opportunity and the aspirations of automobile workers, American Journal of Sociology, 57, 5, pp. 453-459, (1952); Chinoy E., Automobile Workers and The American Dream, (1965); Coyle J.J., Bardi E.J., Novack R.A., Transportation, (2000); Crawford L., Dombey D., Houlder V., Shelley T., The Prestige Has Awakened Concerns That Maritime Safety Standards Are Inadequate, But Improvements Are Coming Slowly, (2002); Dizard III, Wilson P., TSA, industry dispute TWIC flaw claims, Government Computer News, (2007); Donn C.B., Concession bargaining in the ocean-going maritime industry, Industrial and Labor Relations Review, 42, 2, pp. 189-200, (1989); Edmonson R.G., TWIC card rules published, Journal of Commerce, (2007); Edmonson R.G., Two-step: Industry says rule-making on transport worker IDs is a move in the right direction, Journal of Commerce, (2007); Edmonson R.G., Customs adding up 10+2; Penalties won't start for months, but the agency isn't waiting to notify violators, Journal of Commerce, (2010); Eisenhardt K.M., Agency-and institutional-theory explanations: The case of retail sales compensation, Academy of Management Journal, 31, 3, pp. 488-511, (1988); Eisenhardt K.M., Agency theory: An assessment and review, Academy of Management Review, 14, pp. 57-74, (1989); Fedor L., Pilots Union Reaches Deal with Mesaba: Talks with Attendants and Mechanics Continue, as the Carrier Struggles Through Bankruptcy, (2006); Fedor L., Mesaba reaches deal with attendants: Talks continue with the mechanics union as the regional carrier strives to secure deals with three big unions, Star Tribune, (2006); Flynn S.E., American the Vulnerable: How Our Government is Failing to Protect Us from Terrorism, (2004); Flynn S.E., The Edge of Disaster: Rebuilding a Resilient Nation, (2007); Frittelli J.F., Port and Maritime Security: Background and Issues for Congress, (2005); Gettleman J., Somalia pirates capture tanks and global notice, New York Times, (2008); Gettleman J., Somalia's pirates flourish in a lawless nation, New York Times, (2008); Gittell J.H., von Nordenflycht A., Kochan T.A., Mutual gains or zero sum?

Organisational support involves the provision of valued financial benefits along with employees' perceptions of support from supervisors and co-workers, and procedural fairness in decision-making. We found strong evidence that high levels of organisational support lead to employee reciprocity via increased affective commitment and job satisfaction and reduced turnover intentions. We also found evidence, albeit weaker, of a positive relationship between economic exchange and continuance commitment, where employees may be dissatisfied but stay because they have too much invested in firm specific knowledge and skills. The firm provided above average compensation and benefits and with limited alternative job opportunities in the formal economy in Sri Lanka the costs of leaving the organisation are likely to have outweighed the costs of staying.","Affective commitment;

That government explicitly intended these changes to reduce labour market rewards to, and protections for, low paid and more vulnerable employees. Yet, it also deployed a rhetoric of individual choice in advocating these changes, promoting, in particular, a notion that individual bargaining and agreement making under Work Choices empowered individual employees by opening opportunities for integrative (mutual gains) bargaining. This article asks what these changes really meant for bargaining between individual employee and employer. We analyse crucial elements of Work Choices to highlight how its main structural mechanisms intensified employee bargaining weakness in individual bargaining. As well, we use negotiation theory, especially in relation to integrative bargaining, to evaluate the government's own published advice to individual employees on how to bargain for an AWA. We find that the government explicitly sought to disempower employees through Work Choices' additional legal and institutional impediments and also through the concerted attempt at coaching employees to choose a losing path in their AWA negotiations.","","","AAP 'Low-paid workers unhappy on AWAs: Study, Sydney Morning Herald, (2007); Abelson R., Psychological status of the script concept, American Psychologist, 36, pp. 715-729, (1981); ACCC (australian competition and consumer commission), Guide to Collective Bargaining Notifications, (2007); AHRI (australian human resources institute), WorkChoices: Its Impact Within Australian Workplaces, (2007); AIRC (australian industrial relations commission), AIRCFB35, (2007); Anderson C., Thompson L., Affect from the top down: How powerful individuals' positive affect shapes negotiations, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 95, 2, pp. 125-139, (2004); Australian Government WorkChoices: A simpler, fairer, National Workplace Relations System for Australia: Overview, (2005); Australian government workplace authority, Tips for Negotiating your Workplace Agreement, (2007); Bacharach S., Lawler E., Power and tactics in bargaining, Industrial and Labor Relations Review, 32, 2, pp. 219-233, (1981); Briggs C., Cooper R., Between individualism and collectivism?

This article draws together insights from economic sociology, history and democratic theory to engage in further discussion about the proper role of central banks in democratic society. We stress some related themes. Our brief history of central banks aims to show how these banks have always been embedded in economic and political coalitions and conflicts, therefore qualifying the term independence; our study also aims to show that in satisficing between conflicting tasks, central banks need to maintain a balance between cognitive competences and normative expectations. Independence is better understood as a form of dependence on the coalition of interests that supported the financial climate prevailing before the global crisis of 2008, one of low wage-price inflation, high borrowing and debt, and loss of prudential control. We argue that independence amounts to a form of re-privatisation of central banks, and that they are increasingly suborned to the pressures of financial markets. At the same time, asset price inflation has sacrificed growth and employment and therefore prolongs the crisis. The economic measures now demanded by the financial crisis prompt new doubts about the independent central bank experiment, potentially in favour of the ex ante model of governmental oversight of central banks. © The Author(s) 2013.","Central bank independence; central bank principles; democratic mandate and institutional design; E52; E58; G28; H50; monetary and fiscal policy; social economics","","Ahamed L., Lords of Finance: The Bankers Who Broke the World, (2009); Ahamed L., Europe's bankers have forgotten the lessons of the depression, Financial Times (FT), (2012); Albrow M., The Global Age, (1996); Alesina A., Gatti R., Independent central banks: Low inflation at no cost, American Economic Review, 85, 2, pp. 196-200, (1995); Alessandri P., Haldane A.S., Banking on the state, Bank of England Paper to Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Conference, (2009); Baker D., Schmitt J., The Macroeconomic Roots of High European Unemployment: The Impact of Foreign Growth, (1999); Braithwaite J., Drahos P., Global Business Regulation, (2000); Budd L., Whimster S., Global Finance and Urban Living: A Study of Metropolitan Change, (1992); Capie F., Goodhart C., The Future of Central Banking: The Tercentenary Symposium of the Bank of England, (1994); Davies H., Green D., Banking on the Future: The Fall and Rise of Central Banking, (2010); Debelle G., Fischer S., Conference Series; [Proceedings], pp. 195-225, (1994); Dennaoui Y., Sinn und Macht in der Globalen Moderne, (2010); Dow S.C., Financial Crises and the Nature of Capitalist Money: Mutual Developments from the Work of Geoffrey Ingham; Down I., Central bank independence, disinflations and the sacrifice ratio, Comparative Political Studies, 37, 4, pp. 399-443, (2004); Forder J., The Theory of Credibility and the Reputation-bias of Policy, Review of Political Economy, 13, 1, pp. 5-25, (2001); Franzese R.J., Partially independent central banks, politically responsive governments, and inflation, American Journal of Political Science, 43, 3, pp. 681-706, (1999); Galbraith J.K., Money: Whence It Came, Where It Went, (1975); Goodman J.B., The politics of central bank independence, Comparative Politics, 23, 3, pp. 329-349, (1991); Goodhart C., The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics, (1987); Greenspan A., The Challenge of Central Banking in A Democratic Society, (1996); Haldane A., The Contribution of the Financial Sector: Miracle or Mirage?Speech of the Executive Director, Financial Stability, Bank of England, 14July, (2010); Hirsch F., Goldthorpe J., The Political Economy of Inflation, (1978); Hutton W., The State we'Re in, (1995); Ingham G., Capitalism Divided? the City and Industry in British Social Development, (1984); Ingham G., The Nature of Money, (2004); Ingham G., Capitalism, (2011); Jenkins R., Churchill, (2001); Keynes J.M., The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money, (1936); Kindleberger C.P., Manias, Panics and Crashes: A History of Financial Crises, (1989); Klomp J., De Haan J., Inflation and central bank independence: A meta-regression analysis, Journal of Economic Surveys, 24, 4, pp. 593-621, (2010); Kriesler P., The current financial crisis: Causes and policy, Economic and Labour Relations Review, 19, 2, pp. 17-26, (2009); Kurzer P., The politics of central banks: Austerity and unemployment, Journal of Public Policy, 8, 1, pp. 21-48, (1988); Kynaston D., City of London: The History, (2011); Mannheim K., Ideology and Utopia, (1936); Meyer John W., Weltkultur.

Using the betting market point spread as a proxy for uncertainty of outcome, two key points concerning the UOH emerge: college football fans in these conferences prefer less uncertainty of outcome both when their team is a home favorite and when their team is a home underdog.","Attendance demand; NCAA football; Uncertainty of outcome hypothesis","","Borland J., Lye J., Attendance at Australian Rules football: A panel study, Applied Economics, 24, 9, pp. 1053-1058, (1992); Coates D., Humphreys B., Week to week attendance and competitive balance in the National Football League, International Journal of Sport Finance, 5, 4, pp. 239-252, (2010); Coates D., Humphreys B., Zhou L., Outcome uncertainty, referencedependent preferences and live game attendance, pp. 2012-2016, (2012); Forrest D., Simmons R., Outcome uncertainty and attendance demand in sport: The case of English soccer, The Statistician, 51, 2, pp. 229-241, (2002); Fort R., Thinking (some more) about competitive balance, Journal of Sports Economics, 4, 4, pp. 280-283, (2003); Humphreys B., Watanabe N., Competitive balance, The Oxford Handbook of Sports Economics, 1, (2012); Knowles G., Sherony K., Haupert M., The demand for Major League Baseball: A test of the uncertainty of outcome hypothesis, American Economist, 36, 2, pp. 72-80, (1992); Meehan J., Nelson R., Richardson T., Competitive balance and game attendance in Major League Baseball, Journal of Sports Economics, 8, 6, pp. 563-580, (2007); Owen P., Weatherston C., Uncertainty of outcome and Super 12 Rugby Union attendance, Journal of Sports Economics, 5, 4, pp. 347-370, (2004); Quirk J., Fort R., Paydirt: The Business of Professional Sports, (1992); Paul R., Weinbach A., Weinbach C., Fair bets and profitability in college football gambling, Journal of Economics and Finance, 27, 2, pp. 236-242, (2003); Rascher D., A test of the optimal positive production network externality in Major League Baseball, Sports Economics: Current Research, (1999); Sanderson A., Siegfried J., Thinking about competitive balance, Journal of Sports Economics, 4, 4, pp. 255-279, (2003); Sauer R., The economics of wagering markets, Journal of Economic Literature, 36, 4, pp. 2021-2064, (1998)","R.

It was not until late 2006 that we saw any kind of official acknowledgement of a problem. On 12 October 2006, Prime Minister Howard announced a 'Skills for the Future' policy that involved a commitment to spend $837 million over five years, and aimed 'to help build a more highly skilled and responsive workforce to support Australia's long-term economic growth'. Acknowledging that policy-making begins with the framing or constitution of a problem, assessments are offered of this federal government's account of the 'skill shortage' problem. The questions posed in this article are: what policy initiatives during the Howard years were designed to address issues of training, and what was their potential for addressing the problem of an apparent shortage of skilled workers in Australia?.","","","Age editorial 'do the maths: Neglect plus shortages equals crisis, The Age, (2007); AIG (Australian Industry Group), World Class Skills for World Class Industries: Employers' Perspectives on Skilling in Australia, (2006); Birrell B., Rapson V., Clearing the Myths Away: Higher Education's Place in Meeting Workforce Demands, (2006); Colebatch T., Economist urges a new way on jobs, The Age, (2005); DEST (Australian Government Department of Education Science and Training), (2005); DEST Skills for the Future, (2006); DEST Australian Apprenticeships, (2007); Donaldson C., Talent Shortage Impacts Wage Inflation, (2006); Employment workplace relations and education references committee, Bridging the Skills Divide, (2003); Hansard H.O.R., Votes and Proceedings-Hansard, (2006); Houston C., Schneiders B., Housing costs soar with skills shortage, The Age, (2007); Howard J., Address to, The Australian Financial Review, (2006); Kirby P., (Chair) Ministerial Review of Postcompulsory Education Pathways in Victoria, (2000); Maiden S., New tech colleges in crisis, The Australian; Maiden S., Mr Fix-it has tools to restore colleges, The Australian, (2007); Manpower Confronting the Coming Talent Crunch: What's Next?, (2006); Talent shortage and wage inflation survey global results, Manpower Professional, (2006); NCVER (National Centre for Vocational Education Research Ltd.), Australian Apprenticeships, Facts Fiction and the Future, (2001); NCVER Australian Vocational Education and Training Statistics: Apprentices and Trainees-June Quarter 2004, (2004); NCVER Australian Vocational Education and Training Statistics: Apprentices and Trainees-June Quarter 2005, (2005); NCVER Australian vocational education and training statistics: Apprentices and trainees-June quarter 2006, (2006); NCVER Australian vocational education and training statistics: Apprentices and trainees - September quarter 2006, (2007); Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Education at a Glance: OECD Indicators 2006, (2006); Review of Government Service Provision: Part B Education, Chapter 4m Vocational Education and Training, (2007); Reserve Bank of Australia Statement on monetary policy, (1999); Richardson S., What is a Skill Shortage?, (2007); Shaw M., Rood D., Apprentices a dying breed and economy will pay: ACTU, The Age, (2004); Tingle L., PM changes tack on skills crisis, Australian Financial Review, (2006); VECCI (Victorian employers' chamber of commerce and industry), Victorian Skills Survey, (2007); Vines J., Time to box clever on skills deficit, Australian Financial Review, (2007)","","","SAGE Publications Ltd","10353046","","","","English","Econ.

This article examines the experience of the Port Macquarie Base Hospital (PMBH), the first public hospital delivered under the Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) model in the State of New South Wales, Australia. Using a framework adapted from Macário, this study focuses on the political climate in which this PPP mechanism was implemented, identifying the underlying motives driving the use of a PPP to deliver public health services and clarifying the essential conflicts undermining the PPP process. The article covers the entire life cycle of the PPP hospital, from the initial contracting process to its eventual sale. A political desire to reduce public debt, allied with an ideology assuming private sector superiority, made this approach particularly attractive, but failed to deliver the desired outcome. The success of PPPs would appear to depend strongly on goal alignment in a multi-level political system. Auditing processes during the implementation process need to take account of the presence or absence of such alignment.","","","Inquiry uncovers hospital waiting list manipulation, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, (2002);

Moreover, during their active career, their health is monitored on a regular basis. However, whenever a (former) well-known athlete dies, such an event is publicised widely. Perceived mortality among athletes may be distorted. In this article, we examine medium-term mortality of professional soccer players in The Netherlands. More specifically, we answer two questions. First, we examine if the mortality of soccer players is significantly different from mortality in the general population. Second, we assess whether mortality varies by team. We find that mortality among soccer players is significantly lower than in the general population, with no significant between teams variation. The methodology used in this article is easily extended to examine atypical mortality among other groups of athletes.","Mortality; Professional soccer; Splines","","Belli S., Vanacore N., Proportionate mortality of Italian soccer players: Is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis an occupational disease?, European Journal of Epidemiology, 20, 3, pp. 237-242, (2005); Currie I., Durban M., Eilers P., Smoothing and forecasting mortality rates, Statistical Modelling, 4, 4, pp. 279-298, (2004); Dudink A., Birth date and sporting success, Nature, 368, (1994); Harrell Jr. F.E., Regression Modelling Strategies, (2001); Redelmeier D.A., Singh S.M., Survival in Academy Award-winning actors and actresses, Annals of Internal Medicine, 134, 10, pp. 955-962, (2001); Sarna S., Sahi T., Koskenvuo M., Kaprio J., Increased life expectancy of world class male athletes, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 25, 2, pp. 237-244, (1993); Taioli E., All causes mortality in male professional soccer players, European Journal of Public Health, 17, 6, pp. 600-604, (2007); Teramoto M., Bungum T.J., Mortality and longevity of elite athletes, Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport, 13, pp. 410-416, (2010)","","","SAGE Publications Ltd","10353046","","","","English","Econ.

This article describes and explains existing data and discussion in Australia, within a cross-national context. Primarily drawing on official labour force data, it begins by examining the proportion of employees engaged in long hours, trends in long work hours, and selected characteristics of the long hours workforce. It then links the discussion to overtime and the peculiar prominence of what is called ‘unpaid’ overtime. Growth in unpaid overtime seems to be the main component in the increase in the proportion of full-time employees working long hours. In seeking to explain these developments, the article describes the framework of formal working-time regulation and identifies several channels along which trends to long hours, whether based on paid or unpaid overtime, are able to flow. It then looks at the way in which the opportunities opened up by the deficiencies in regulation are taken up by employees and employers. It suggests that the key factor in explaining the development of long hours in Australia is employer pressure within the framework of weak working-time regulation. © 2007, University of New South Wales.

These outbursts have typically been examined as separate events, but, analysed together, they provide an opportunity to see racism, and anti-racism, as historical and social processes. In all these riots, returned soldiers, organised by a leadership often drawn from the officer class, played a significant part in harassing migrants and promoting White Australia. Through this lens, an important corrective to the dominant explanation of the White Australia policy is suggested. While most historians of Australian racism portray immigration restriction as a demand successfully won by the labour movement in defence of white workers' jobs, the Kalgoorlie race riots expose a distinctly conservative case for employer 'divide and rule', anti-migrant propaganda and racist violence. Concomitantly, the local labour movement found that racial division among their ranks was a recipe for industrial defeat.","","","Bertola P., Ethnic Difference in Kalgoorlie, pp. 1893-1934, (1978); Bertola P., Kalgoorlie, Gold, and the World Economy, pp. 1893-1972, (1993);

First, we examine what is meant by minimum labour standards, including the array of different standards and their procedural and substantive elements, in differing or even diverging regulatory jurisdictions. Examination of different areas of labour standards provides instruction in the dynamics of these protections and we give illustrative examples, from several countries. The second objective is to highlight the importance of enforcement of standards. We do this through a brief historical overview of the emergence of labour standards as well as of how the recent rise of neo-liberalism has shaped current debates over their development and application. The third element of the analysis is an examination of some contemporary debates, pointing to areas requiring further study as well as to positive examples both in research and in policy/regulation.","China; Decent work; Labour standards enforcement; Minimum labour standards; Neoliberalism; Occupational health; Procedural rights; Substantive union rights; Vulnerable workers; Working conditions","","Adams R.J., Industrial Relations under Liberal Democracy: North America in Comparative Perspective, University of South Carolina Press.

Like the term 'contingent work', precarious employment has been adopted and increasingly used by academic researchers and later policymakers since the 1980s. However, the term has deeper historical roots and its recent use can be more accurately seen as a revival as labour markets have taken on some features characteristic of an earlier period. This article examines the use of the term 'precarious employment' in political and public debate in the century or more prior to the 1930s, finding that in key respects, this use mirrors contemporary debates. Recognising that precarious employment was a pervasive feature of labour markets in developed countries prior to World War Two has a number of major benefits for contemporary debates. These include a better understanding of the policies that shape the extent of precarious employment. Historical evidence also provides a guide for and reinforcement of a growing body of contemporary research, pointing to both the immediate and broader social effects of precarious employment. © 2012, The Economic and Labour Relations Review.","Casual employment; Contingent work; Day labour; Employment insecurity; Labour contractors; Precariat; Precarious employment; Subcontractors; Temporary work; Transient workers","","Andersen B., Lindemann R., Bergh K., Nesheim, Syversen G., Solheim N., Laugerud F., Spread of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in a neonatal intensive care unit associated with understaffing, overcrowding and mixing of patients, Journal of Hospital Infection, 50, 1, pp. 18-24, (2002); Arlidge J., The Hygiene Diseases and Mortality of Occupations, (1892); Aronsson G., Contingent workers and health and safety, Work, Employment and Society, 13, 3, pp. 439-459, (1999); Aronsson G., Gustafsson K., Dallner M., Sick but yet at work.

For nearly twenty years, the retirement system has comprised just a universal state pension, called New Zealand Superannuation, and voluntary unsubsidised private saving. The decision in the late 1980s to promote tax neutrality for saving was critical to attaining a cost-effective, adequate, equitable and sustainable retirement income for all in an uncertain future. Nevertheless, a level playing field was only partially achieved and by the early 2000s large imbalances in the economy were apparent. Strident calls to promote saving gradually undermined the accord around tax neutrality for retirement saving leading in 2007 to the reintroduction of tax incentives for certain types of saving, and other types of state intervention in private provision. This paper examines how the twenty year experiment with tax neutrality is coming to an end and the implications this has for the support of an aging population experiencing increased longevity.","","","Bollard A., What's Happening in the Property Sector?, 67, 3, pp. 37-46, (2004); (1988); Cullen M., (2001); Cullen M., (2003); Cullen M., Taxation of Investment Income: The Treatment of Collective Investment Vehicles and Offshore Portfolio Investments in Shares, (2005); Dalsgaard T., The tax System in New Zealand: An Appraisal and Options for Change, (2001); Douglas R., Changes to the Personal tax Scale, (1987); Douglas R., (1988); Easton B., The Commercialisation of New Zealand, (1997); Easton B., In Stormy Seas: The Post-War New Zealand Economy, (1997); Hagemann R., Jones B., Montador R., Tax Reform in OECD Countries: Economic Rationale and Consequences, (1987); Hughes G., Pension tax Reliefs and Equity, (2005); (2006); Johnson P., (1999); Optimal taxation and spending in general competitive growth models, Journal of Public Economics, 71, pp. 1-26, (1999); Le T., Scobie G., Gibson J., Are kiwis saving enough for retirement?, Preliminary Evidence From SOFIE, (2007); Committee M.C., (1982); McLeod R., The Issues: Tax Review 2001, (2001); (2002); (2006); Mourougane A., (2007); Munnell A., Current Taxation of Qualified Pension Plans: Has the Time Come?, pp. 49-63, (1992); (2007); (2007); (1997); (2003); (2007); (2007); (2004); Scobie G., Gibson J., Le T., (2004); Sinfield A., Tax benefits in non-state pensions, European Journal of Social Security, 2, 2, pp. 137-167, (2000); Skilling D., Home is Where the Money is: The Economic Importance of Savings, Discussion Paper No. 2005/1, New Zealand Institute, (2005); St John S., Child poverty: Lessons from new zealand, European Journal of Social Security, 8, 3, pp. 299-316, (2006); St John S., (2006); St John S., New Zealand's Experiment in tax Neutrality for Retirement Saving, 32, 4, pp. 532-552, (2007); John S., And S., Ashton T., Private Pensions in New Zealand: Can They Avert the Crisis?, (1993); John S., And S., Gran B., The World's Social Laboratory: Women-friendly Aspects of New Zealand Pensions, pp. 199-215, (2001); John S., And S., Littlewood M., Does KiwiSaver Improve the Unique New Zealand mix of Retirement Policies?, (2006); (2002); (2007); Stobo C., (2004); (1992); Treasury Report: Saving Incentive Options - Consultation and Analysis, (2001); (2007); (2007); (1997); Wynd D., Kiwi Scammer: Helping (some) New Zealanders Retire Richer, (2007); Yoo K., De Serres A., (2004)","","","SAGE Publications Ltd","10353046","","","","English","Econ.

Evaluations of the effects of the change of policy, ownership, control and regulatory arrangements that have accompanied privatisation and their impact on the longer-term stock of infrastructure and the growth of the economy have received less attention than the immediate privatisation decisions. This article reviews some of the studies that have been carried out to evaluate the impact of privatisation, focusing on long-term impacts on infrastructure provision. In particular, it discusses the myopia created by the emphasis on commercial transactions and managing markets that continues to shape the debate about the provision of infrastructure to meet Australia's economic, environmental and other objectives. Objectives have become even more difficult to achieve as an increasingly extensive and complex regulatory framework is required to manage privatised activities. This adds to costs and limits the potential for the introduction of new initiatives to address pressing prob lems. The issue is increasingly relevant, given the current perceived shortage of infrastructure and the flow-on effects of the current international financial crisis on Australia. The slow-down in economic growth accompanying the financial crisis is putting pressure on government budgets and threatening to perpetuate the existing policy bias towards short-term solutions, exacerbating the longer run problem of ensuring an adequate supply of public economic infrastructure.","","","The Contract State: Public Management and the Kennett Government, (1994); Aschauer D., Is public expenditure productive?, Journal of Monetary Economics, 23, 2, pp. 177-200; Aulich C., Hein J., Whole of government approaches to outsourcing and market testing by the Commonwealth government, Australian Journal of Public Administration, 63, 3, pp. 35-45, (2005); Howard's Second and Third Governments; Australian Commonwealth Administration, (2005); Howard's Fourth Government; Australian Commonwealth Administration 2004-2007, (2008); Queensland Government Sellets to Pay Debts: Opposition, (2007); Braithwaite J., Accountability and governance under the new regulatory state, Australian Journal of Public Administration, 58, 1, pp. 90-93, (1999); Infrastructure: Action Plan for Future Prosperity, (2005); Chester L., What Are the Outcomes and Who Benefits from the Restructuring of the Australian Electricity Sector?, (2007); Chester L., Johnson M., A new approach needed for Australia's infrastructure, Essays in Heterodox Economics, pp. 68-86, (2006); Chester L., Johnson M., A New Form of Australian State?, (2007); Collyer R., Wettenhall R., McMaster J., The privatisation of public enterprises: Australian research findings, Just Policy, 31, pp. 14-23, (2003); Infrastructure: Getting on with the Job, (2004); Considine M., Enterprising States: The Public Management of Welfare to Work, (2001); Australia's Infrastructure: National Overview Report, (2007); Council of Australian Governments Communique, (2008); Domberger S., Piggott J., Privatisation policies and public enterprise, The Economic Record, 62, 177, pp. 145-162, (1986); Microeconomic Reform in Australia, (1992); National Competition Policy; Report, (1993); Johnson M., Infrastructure and Australia's economic and social development through the 1990s : AAAssessing the problem and the priorities, Interim Report: Commissioned Studies, pp. 1-33, (1995); Johnson M., Evaluating the privatisation of the English and Welsh water industry, The Economic and Labour Relations Review, 3, 2, pp. 12-91, (1992); Johnson M., The impact of new public management on the reform of transportation infrastructure in Sydney, Learning from Public Management Reform: Research in Public Policy Analysis and Management, (2001); Johnson M., Is the existing ethical framework sufficient to manage the current extension of contracting and competition in the public sector?, Australian Lournal of Applied and Professional Ethics, 9, 2, pp. 96-105, (2007); Keating M., Who Rules?

In this context, it is timely to revisit the Marxian concept that profits derive from the dual role of labour, as both a commodity and a non-commodity. Surplus is created by the difference between the commodity dimension of labour, the value of labour power, and its non-commodity dimension - the value added by labour, over and above the value of inputs, or the cost of reproducing the workforce. Since the 1980s and 1990s, however, labour has become a commodity in a new sense. Risks to working class self-reproduction in the form of wage decline and withdrawal of state welfare, have pushed workers into becoming entrepreneurs of their own lives, calculating the risks of debt servicing and involuntarily buying services from privatised and financialised utilities and health care providers. In this sense, newly commodified labour is required to treat itself as a commercial entity, and it is thereby a player in the market for risk. The reproduction of labour power has itself become a source of surplus value, in the form of interest payments. But, as indicated by the US sub-prime housing market and its fall-out, capital now shares in the risk, through a fall in the value of labour power (lower consumption), and through incalculable financial instability.","","","Bryan D., Minimum living standards and the working class surplus: Higgins, henderson and housing, Labour History, 95, pp. 213-222, (2008); Bryan D., Rafferty M., Capitalism with Derivatives: A Political Economy of Financial Derivatives, Capital and Class, (2006); Bryan D., Rafferty M., Financial derivatives: Bubble or anchor?, Global Finance in the New Century, (2007); Bryan D., Rafferty M., Financial derivatives and the theory of money, Economy and Society, 36, 1, pp. 134-158, (2007); Campbell J.Y., Household finance, Journal of Finance, 61, 4, pp. 1553-1604, (2006); Engels F., Anti-duhring, Part II: Political Economy VII.

One factor that motivates governments to fund national sports teams is the potential to exploit the elevation in nationalistic pride that attends international sporting success. Drawing on research in the psychology of sport, this article contends that politicians can access the 'reflective glow' of successful athletes for their political benefit. The statistical correlation between government funding and Olympic success is explored using the basic prisoners' dilemma to represent the decisions of two governments competing for sports success. While the analysis is simple, we argue that it sheds some light on recent examples and represents a first step in understanding this complex issue.","Game theory; International sports funding; Olympic Games; Political opportunity cost","","Sport and Recreation: A Statistical Overview, 2006, (2006); Additional $100M needed for London success, (2009); Australian Sports Commission Annual Reports; Baade R., Matheson V., An assessment of the economic impact of the American Football Championship, the Super Bowl, on host communities, Reflets et Perspectives, 39, 2-3, pp. 35-46, (2000); Baade R., Matheson V., The quest for the Cup: Assessing the economic impact of the World Cup, Regional Studies, 38, 4, pp. 341-352, (2004); Berman G., Brooks R., Davidson S., The Sydney Olympic Games announcement and Australian stock market reaction, Applied Economic Letters, 7, 12, pp. 781-784, (2000); Buchanan J., An economic theory of clubs, Economica, 32, pp. 1-14, (1965); Cialdini R., Borden R., Thorne A., Walker M., Freeman S., Sloan L., Basking in reflected glory: Three (football) studies, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 34, 3, pp. 366-375, (1976); Cialdini R., Richardson K., Two indirect tactics of image management: Basking and blasting, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 39, 3, pp. 406-415, (1980); Coates D., Humphreys B., Do economists reach a conclusion on subsidies for sports franchises, stadiums, and mega-events?, Econ Journal Watch, 5, 3, pp. 294-315, (2008); Crawford D., The Crawford Review: The Future of Sport in Australia, (2009); Davis M., End C., A winning proposition: The economic impact of successful NFL franchises, Economic Inquiry, 48, 1, pp. 39-50, (2010); Downs A., An Economic Theory of Democracy, (1957); Groothuis P., Public funding of professional sports stadiums: Public choice or civil pride?, Eastern Economic Journal, 30, 4, pp. 515-526, (2004); Hogan K., Norton K., The ""price"" of Olympic gold, Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport, 3, 2, pp. 203-218, (2002); Hone P., Silvers R., Measuring the contribution of sport to the economy, The Australian Economic Review, 39, 4, pp. 412-419, (2006); Hudson I., Sabotage versus public choice: Sports as a case study for interest group theory, Journal of Economic Issues, 36, 4, pp. 1079-1096, (2002); Johnson D., Ali A., Coming to play or coming to win: Participation and success at the Olympic Games, (2000); Johnson D., Ali A., Tale of two seasons: Participation and medal counts at the summer and winter Olympic Games, (2002); Johnson B., Groothuis P., Whitehead J., The value of public goods generated by a major league sports team: The CVM approach, Journal of Sports Economics, 2, 1, pp. 6-21, (2001); Juvenal, The Sixteen Satires, (2004); Leeds M., Do good Olympics make good neighbours?, Contemporary Economic Policy, 26, 3, pp. 460-467, (2008); Li H., Meng L., Wang Q., The Government's role in China's Olympic glory, Applied Economics, 41, 25, pp. 3313-3318, (2009); Mitchell H., Stewart M., A competitive index for international sport, Applied Economics, 39, 5, pp. 587-603, (2007); Own The Podium, (2011); Schelling T., The Strategy of Conflict, (1961); Schwarz N., Starck F., Kommer D., Wagner D., Soccer, rooms, and the quality of life: Mood effects on judgments of satisfaction with life in general and with specific domains, European Journal of Social Psychology, 17, 1, pp. 69-79, (1987); Siegfried J., Zimbalist A., The economics of sports facilities and their communities, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 14, 3, pp. 95-114, (2000); Smith A., An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, (1776); Sterken E., Kuper G., Participation and performance at the Olympic summer games, Economy and Sport, 3, pp. 13-20, (2003); Torgler B., The economics of the FIFA Football World Cup, Kyklos, 57, 2, pp. 287-300, (2004); Veraros N., Kasimati E., Dawson P., The 2004 Olympic Games announcement and its effect on the Athens and Milan stock exchanges, Applied Economic Letters, 11, 12, pp. 749-753, (2004); Wann D., Branscombe N., Die-hard and fair-weather fans: Effects of identification on BIRGing and CORFing tendencies, Journal of Sport and Social Issues, 14, 2, pp. 103-117, (1990); Wulz R., Determining charges for municipal stadiums and auditoriums, Municipal Finance, 30, pp. 91-96, (1957)","H.

We investigate the labour supply elasticities of these workers, over time, and across countries, within a ceteris paribus condition. The estimates reveal a shift rather than a movement along the supply curve. We find that ambiguities are due to the absence, in the theory, of a clear distinction between a change in consumption that is partly due to changes in the wage rate and partly due to changes in purchasing power. We apply a new pluralist approach to the standard income-leisure choice framework and provide for a more systematic and consistent method of measuring variations in labour supply, with policy implications.","Compensated wage elasticity; Cost price of leisure; Income (-consumption) leisure choice framework; Reservation wage; Uncompensated wage elasticity","","Aaberge R., Colombino U., Strom S., Labour supply in Italy: An empirical analysis of joint household decisions, with taxes and quantity constraints, Journal of Applied Econometrics, 14, 4, pp. 403-422, (1999); ABS (Australian Bureau of Statistics), Australian Social Trends, (2006); ABS, Year Book Australia, (2007); Ballard L.C., Fullerton D., Shoven B.J., Whalley J., A General Equilibrium Model for Tax Policy Evaluation, (1985); Becker S.G., Human Capital: A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis, with Special Reference to Education, (1975); Blundell R., MaCurdy T., Labor supply: A review of alternative approaches, Handbook of Labor Economics, 3 A, pp. 1559-1695, (1999); Card D., Intertemporal labour supply: An asssessment, Advances in Econometrics, (1994); Borjas J.G., Labor Economics, (2005); Breunig R., Cobb-Clark D.A., Gong X., Improving the modeling of couples' labour supply, Discussion Paper, 1773, the Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA), (2005); Buddelmeyer H., Creedy J., Kalb G., Tax Policy Design and Behavioural Microsimulation Modelling, (2007); Caruso C.C., Hitchcock E.M., Dick R.B., Russo J.M., Schmit J.M., Overtime and Extended Work Shifts: Recent Findings on Illnesses, Injuries, and Health Behaviors, (2004); Cavagnoli D., Addiction to work: An inelastic wage elasticity of labour supply equals long hours of work, Australian Journal of Labour Economics, 11, 2, pp. 129-147, (2008); Duxbury L., Higgins C., Work-life Balance in Australia in the New Millennium: Rhetoric Versus Reality, (2008); Finnegan A., A cross-sectional analysis of hours of work, Journal of Political Economy, 89, pp. 1059-1085, (1962); Gronau R., Home production a survey, Handbook of Labour Economics, 1, pp. 273-304, (1986); Hamermesh S.D., Rees A., The Economics of Work and Pay, (1993); Hamermesh S.D., Slemrod B.J., The economics of workaholism: We should not have worked on this paper, The B.

While the ancient Greeks did not have a concept of labour as a measure of value, in Scholastic authors the notion was fixed that labour and cost of production determine value. Labour assumed a central role in Adam Smith, but it was with David Ricardo that a fully blown labour theory of value was achieved. Marx gave the concept its philosophical dimension, tying it to a critique of classical political economy. The labour theory of value came under attack in neoclassical formulations which in the end effected the analytical disappearance of labour in several ways. Labour became just another factor of production, with marginal productivity regulating its price. Then factors of production and final goods became analytically equivalent as sources of subjective utility, especially in the context of general equilibrium theory. In disutility models of labour supply, labour was substituted by its absence, 'leisure'. Finally, attempts were made to explain the employment relationship as an application of agency theory, moving away from the pure commodity model of labour. Nevertheless, all these theories failed to account for what became the Achilles' heel of neoclassicism - namely the indeterminacy of the labour contract.","","","Efficiency Wage Models of the Labor Market, (1986); Applebaum H., The Concept of Work: Ancient, Medieval, and Modern, (1992); Nicomachean Ethics, (1926); The Politics, (1932); Arrow K.J., Debreu G., Existence of an equilibrium for a competitive economy, Econometrica, 22, 3, pp. 265-269, (1954); Aspromourgos T., On the Origins of Classical Economics: Distribution and Value from William Petty to Adam Smith, (1996); Aspromourgos T., The Science of Wealth: Adam Smith and the Framing of Political Economy, (2009); De opere monachorum, Patrologiae Cursus Completus⋯, 40, pp. 547-582, (1887); Baeck L., The Mediterranean Tradition in Economic Thought, (1994); Baeck L., The legal and scholastic roots of leonardus lessius's economic thought, Storia del Pensiero Economico, No. 37, (1999); Baldamus W., Efficiency and Effort, (1961); Baldwin J.W., The medieval theories of the just price: Romanists, canonists, and theologians in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, N.s., 49, 4, pp. 1-92, (1959); Barbash, Jack, Americanizing the Labor Problem: The Wisconsin School, pp. 41-65, (1994); Barbon N., A Discourse of Trade, (1690); Becker G.S., A theory of the allocation of time, Economic Journal, 40, 299, pp. 493-517, (1965); Becker G.S., The Economic Approach to Human Behavior, (1976); Bharadwaj K., Wages in Classical Economics, 4, pp. 843-846, (1987); Bohm-Bawerk E.V., The ultimate standard of value, Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 5, 2, pp. 149-208, (1894); Bohm-Bawerk E.V., Karl Marx and the Close of his System, pp. 1-118, (1896); Bohm-Bawerk E.V., Kapital und Kapitalzins, (1921); Bohm-Bawerk E.V., Capital and Interest, 3, (1921); Booth A.L., The Economics of the Trade Union, (1995); Braverman H., Labor and Monopoly Capital: The Degradation of Work in the Twentieth Century, (1974); Brown W.A., Social determinants of pay, Industrial Relations: A Social Psychological Approach, pp. 115-130, (1979); Brown W.A., Managing remuneration, Personnel Management in Britain, pp. 249-270, (1989); Brown W.A., Industrial relations and the economy, The Cambridge Economic History of Modern Britain, 3, pp. 399-423, (2004); Brown W.A., Nolan P., Wages and labour productivity: The contribution of industrial relations research to the understanding of pay determination, British Journal of Industrial Relations, 26, 3, pp. 339-361, (1988); Cahuc P., Zylberberg A., Labor Economics, (2004); Cantillon R., Essai sur la Nature du Commerce en General, (1755); Carmichael G., Supplements and observations upon samuel pufendorf's on the duty of man and citizen⋯, Natural Rights on the Threshold of the Scottish Enlightenment: The Writings of Gershom Carmichael, (1724); Cartledge P., The political economy of greek slavery, Money, Labour and Land: Approaches to the Economies of Ancient Greece, pp. 156-166, (2002); Cicero M.T., Tusculan Disputations, (1945); Clark J.B., Recent theories of wages, New Englander and Yale Review, 42, 174, pp. 354-364, (1883); Commons J.R., Myself, (1934); Davanzati B., Lezione delle monete, Idem, Scisma D'Inghilterra Con Altre Operette, (1588); Debreu G., Theory of Value: An Axiomatic Analysis of Economic Equilibrium, (1959); Derobert L., The genesis of the canonical labor supply model, Journal of the History of Economic Thought, 23, 2, pp. 197-215, (2001); Dobb M., Theories of Value and Distribution Since Adam Smith: Ideology and Economic Theory, (1973); Doeringer P.B., Piore M.J., Internal Labor Markets and Manpower Analysis, (1971); Dorfman R., Marginal Productivity Theory, 3, pp. 323-325, (1987); Douglas P.H., The Theory of Wages, (1934); The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics, (1987); Edgeworth F.Y., Mathematical Psychics, (1881); Edgeworth F.Y., The mathematical theory of political economy: Review of leon walras, Æléments d'économie politique pure, (Lausanne: F.

It also reviews the evidence on the debt-growth relationship at some length. It finds that the negative relationship between debtand GDP growth is influenced by outliers or exceptionally high debt-GDP ratios. It also points out that the composition of public debt matters. Additionally, the debt-GDP relationship appears to be non-linear - positive first and turning to negative, but there is considerable variation in the estimated turning or 'tipping' point, which is not helpful as a policy guide. Historical evidence does not lend support to the concerns that the current situation is likely to cause rapid upward spiraling of public indebtedness. Finally, the argument that fiscal consolidation is possible without adversely affecting growth is not based on robust empirical evidence. This conclusion is reinforced by a succinct overview of some country-specific experiences (Denmark, Ireland and United States).","Debt; Europe; Fiscal consolidation; Growth","","Aizenman J., Marion N., Using inflation to erode the U.

It has also been given prominence as a focus of the Rudd Government's social policy agenda. This paper reviews the debate over the definition and measurement of social exclusion, focusing on its relationship with poverty, defined in terms of low-income. The analysis is based on the premise that conceptual and measurement issues can play an important role in identifying causation, and thus point to the kinds of actions needed to address the problem. The argument is illustrated by drawing on recent Australian research that shows that exclusion takes many different but often inter - Connected forms, and that there is a low degree of overlap between exclusion and poverty. The implications of the findings for research and policy are briefly discussed.","","","Arthurson K., Jacobs K., A critique of the concept of social exclusion and its utility for Australian social housing policy, Australian Journal of Social Issues, 39, 1, pp. 25-40, (2004); Atkinson A.B., Social exclusion, poverty and unemployment, Exclusion, Employment and Opportunity, pp. 1-20, (1998); Atkinson A.B., EU social policy, the Lisbon agenda and re-imagining social policy, Henderson Oration, (2007); Atkinson A.B., Cantillon B., Marlier E., Nolan B., Social Indicators. the EU and Social Inclusion, (2002); General Social Survey.

Instead, the direct employers of low wage workers operate in far more competitive markets that create conditions for non-compliance. We examine this evolution in employment and its implications for public policy in the US, discuss the factors driving fissured employment and sketch its main features and outcomes. We then look at the traditional methods used for labour standards enforcement in the US and discuss why they are poorly suited to address fissured workplaces. Finally, we survey how public policies might better address the realities of the modern workplace, including efforts in this regard by the Obama administration.","Compliance; Enforcement; Fissured employment; Labour standards; Regulation","","Abraham K., Tyler S., Firms' use of outside contractors: Theory and evidence, Journal of Labor Economics, 14, 3, pp. 394-424, (1996); Arlen J., McLeod B., Beyond master-servant: A critique of vicarious liability, Exploring Tort Law, pp. 111-142, (2005); Ashenfelter O., Smith R., Compliance with the minimum wage law, Journal of Political Economy, 87, 2, pp. 333-350, (1979); Bardach E., Kagan R., Going by the Book: The Problem of Regulatory Unreasonableness, (1982); Bernhardt A., Boushey H., Dresser L., Tilly C., The Gloves-Off Economy: Workplace Standards at the Bottom of America's Labor Market, (2008); Bernhardt A., Milkman R., Theodore N., Heckathorn D., Auer M., DeFillipis J., Luz Gonzalez A., Narro V., Perelshteyn J., Polson D., Spiller M., Broken Laws, Unprotected Workers: Violations of Employment in Labor Laws in America's Cities, (2009); Blair R., Lafontaine F., The Economics of Franchising, (2005); Brown C., Hamilton J., Medoff J., Employers Large and Small, (1990); Carre F., Ferber M., Golden L., Herzenberg S., Nonstandard Work: The Nature and Challenges of Changing Employment Arrangements, (2000); Carre F., Wilson R., The social and economic costs of employee misclassification in construction, (2004); Estlund C., Who mops the floors at the Fortune 500?

The object of the legislation is to facilitate greater equality in the bargaining power of the parties. Except where the small business sells goods/commodities rather than a service, a person who is 'employed' and the business that provides a 'service' are both effectively involved in the sale of labour or in the performance of work in the labour market. However, the legal concepts and procedures relating to collective bargaining in these two types of labour transactions are different. One, the 'employment' of persons, is placed in the category of workplace relations operating through labour law; the other, the 'sale of services', is viewed as a commercial transaction, dealt with through commercial law. This paper considers the question of whether there are sufficiently significant differences between these labour/service transactions as to justify the application of two separate sets of laws to deal with them - one to cover transactions between employers and employees, and the other to cover transactions between small and large businesses. A case study will be used to illustrate the involved and unsatisfactory approach of the commercial law route in determining what is in essence a labour transaction rather than a commodity transaction.","","","Authorising and Notifying Collective Bargaining: Issues Paper, (2004); Determination Re, (2005); Guide to Collective Bargaining Notifications, (2007); (2007); (2007); (2007); (2008); Collective Bargaining: Making It Easier to Do Business, Whatever the Size of Your Business, (2007); Briggs C., Buchanan J., Watson I., Wages Policy in An Era of Deepening Inequality, (2006); Brunt M., Economic Essays on Australia and New Zealand Competition Law, (2003); Report: Review of the Competition Provisions of the Trade Practices Act, (2003); Howe J., Mitchell R., The evolution of the contract of employment in Australia: A discussion, Australian Journal of Labour Law, 12, pp. 113-130, (1999); Making It Work: Inquiry into Independent Contracting and Labour Hire Arrangements, (2005); Kahn-Freund O., Labour and the Law, (1972); Martin J., Levelling the Playing Field, (2004); McCallum R., Australian labour law after the Work Choices avalanche: Developing and employment law for our children, Journal of Industrial Relations, 49, 3, pp. 436-454, (2007); McCrystal S., Collective bargaining by independent contractors: Challenges from labour law, Australian Journal of Labour Law, 20, 1, pp. 1-28, (2007); McCrystal S., Collective bargaining and the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Act (no.l) 2006 (Cth), Australian Journal of Labour Law, 20, 2, pp. 207-216, (2007); Owens R., Riley J., The Law of Work, (2007); Stewart A., Redefining employment?

It may also constitute a structural impediment to multi-employer bargaining, boxing unions into a system of fragmented bargaining, and results are sensitive to institutional design so there could be serious consequences if the system was re-engineered towards the US model in the future. © 2007, University of New South Wales.

Significant reports, including the Wilkins Review and reports by the Productivity Commission, have argued using the standard neoclassical economics framework that once a carbon price is established, it should be (almost) the only instrument needed to tackle climate change mitigation in Australia. With a small number of exceptions for complementary instruments to address some market failures, the use of other climate policy instruments, it is argued, will result only in unnecessary duplication and potential distortions. The aim of this article is to show that there are, in fact, a significant number of rationales for implementing several climate policy instruments in combination with a carbon price, and we should not be too quick to dismiss certain climate policy instrument combinations.","Carbon pricing; Climate change policy; Complementary policies; Policy interaction; Policy mixes; Renewable energy policy","","Arrow K., The economic implications of learning by doing, Review of Economic Studies, 29, 3, pp. 155-173, (1962); Baldwin R., Regulation lite: The rise of emissions trading, Regulation and Governance, 2, 2, pp. 193-215, (2008); Bartle I., A strategy for better climate change regulation: Towards a public interest orientated regulatory regime, Environmental Politics, 18, 5, pp. 689-706, (2009); Bennear L.S., Stavins R.N., The use of multiple policy instruments for environmental protection, Environmental and Resource Economics, 37, 1, pp. 111-129, (2007); Borenstein S., The Market Value and The Cost of Solar Photovoltaic Electricity Production, (2008); NSW Power Bills Set to Surge, (2011); Strategic Review of Australian Government Climate Change Programs (Wilkins Review), (2008); Australia's Fifth National Communication on Climate Change, (2008); Securing a Clean Energy Future - the Australian Government's Climate Change Plan, (2011); Compston H., The Politics of Climate Policy: Strategic Options for National Governments, Paper Prepared for 5th European Consortium for Political Research General Conference, (2009); Courvisanos J., Optimize versus satisfice: Two approaches to an investment policy in sustainable development, Post Keynesian and Ecological Economics: Confronting Environmental Issues, Edward Elgar, pp. 279-300, (2009); Courvisanos J., Political aspects of innovation, Research Policy, 38, 7, pp. 1117-1124, (2009); Daley J., Edis T., Learning the Hard Way: Australia's Policies to Reduce Emissions, (2011); de Laurentis C., Cooke P., Green Innovation and Policy: A Co-evolutionary Approach, Paper Presented at The DIME International Conference on Innovation, (2008); Denniss R., Macintosh A., Complementary Or Contradictory?

With circumscribed employment rights, the increased significance of temporary migrant workers underscores arguments that globalisation has engendered a more profound commodification of labour. The instrumentalist approach, especially of international financial institutions in promoting temporary labour migration as a panacea for development, reinforces this impression. Encapsulated in migration-development discourse, labour migration, like other commodities, is presented as a means of generating export revenue for the South. Karl Polanyi's critique of this market-defined construct of labour as a commodity, when labour can only ever be a fictitious commodity, provides a basis for contesting the representation of labour in the migration-development discourse. However, recourse to a Marxist method is held to be essential if we are to move beyond an appreciation of the process in order to interrogate the rationale that is driving the transformation of labour.","","","Allam L., Remittances - Flying money transcript, Background Briefing, (2008); Fajnzylber P., Humberto Lopez J., Remittances and Development: Lesions from Latin America, (2008); Civil Society Dialogue, (2008); Hernandez-Coss R., The US-Mexico Remittance Corridor: Lessons on Shifting from Informal to Formal Systems, (2004); Hernandez-Coss R., El-Swaify R., The US-Guatemala Remittance Corridor: Understanding Better the Drivers of Financial Intermediation, (2006); Towards a fair deal for migrant workers in the global economy,  International Labour Conference, 2004, (2004); Lebowitz M., Beyond Capital: Marx's Political Economy of the Working Class, (2003); Luthsia M., Et al., At Home and Away: Expanding Job Opportunities for Pacific Islanders Through Labour Mobility, (2006); Marx K., Capital, 1, (1976); Maimbo S., Ratha D., Remittances: Development Impact and Future Prospects, (2005); Maimbo S., Adams R., Passas N., Aggarwal R., Migrant Labor Remittances in South Asia, (2005); Orozco M., The Remittance Marketplace: Prices, Policy and Financial Institutions, (2004); Polanyi K., The Great Transformation: The Political and Economic Origins of our Times, (1957); Ramamurthy B., International Labour Migration: Unsung Heroes of Globalisation, (2003); Beyond Small Change: Making Migrant Remittances Count, (2005); Winters L.A., Walmsley T., Wang Z.-K., Grynberg R., Liberalising temporary movement of natural persons: An agenda for the development round, World Economy, 26, 8, pp. 1137-1161, (2003); Wodon Q., Migration, Remittances and Poverty: Case Studies from West Africa, (2009); Global Development Finance 2003: Striving for Stability in Development Finance, (2003); Global Economic Prospects 2006: Economic Implications of Remittances and Migration, (2006)","S.

As Kalecki foresaw, the success of Keynesian demand management was undermined when, in an era of full employment, the power of labour threatened industrialists' authority over the economy. From the 1970s, this led governments to introduce pro-capitalist measures. Countering recessions with budget deficits was now seen as irresponsible. The rise of globalisation meant that domestic demand management became less effective, especially in economies highly dependent on imports. Opening up economies meant that their exchange rates and stock markets became more vulnerable to capital flights. As the reach of finance became increasingly global, those private credit rating agencies became the game changers. Today private credit agencies, through their rating of the investment climate and sovereign risk of a country, in effect rate the quality of its government. Capitalist democracies are now dominated by private finance. Management of the investment climate is increasingly done through the virtual rather than the real economy, creating artificial financial asset and housing market bubbles. At the same time, in the neglected real economy, inequality and unemployment have increased, and living standards are falling. © 2012, University of New South Wales.

Its membership includes major business and employer organisations, leaders of the Liberal and National parties, various regulatory bodies, ‘New Right’ think tanks and media commentators. Its modus operandi is doublethink. It advocates deregulation of employment contracts while intervening in their operation and demanding more regulation to ensure that they are loaded in ‘favour’ of employers. The Club has a vision of an industrial relations nirvana where employees voluntarily align their behaviour to the needs of the enterprise. The paper argues that this vision is fundamentally flawed and is the basis of the Club's demand for more regulation. The paper examines the origins and consolidation of the Club, activities and interventions after the election of the Howard Coalition in 1996 and major features of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005 (Cth). © 2006, University of New South Wales.

Since then, two principal sets of tensions have affected the enforcement of such standards: tensions between government and employers, and tensions between the major political parties over industrial and economic issues. This article argues that these tensions have resulted in a sustained legacy affecting minimum labour standards' enforcement in Australia. The article outlines broad historical developments and contexts of minimum labour standards' enforcement in Australia since 1828, with more contemporary exploration focusing specifically on enforcement practices and policies in the Australian federal industrial relations jurisdiction. Current enforcement practices are an outcome of this volatile history, and past influences remain strong.","Enforcement regimes; Enforcement strategies; Labour standards; Public policy; Trade unions","","Andrews K., MP Media Release 074/06, (2006); Arbitration Inspectorate Manual, (1954); Annual Reports, (1984); Commonwealth Gazette, (1989); Commonwealth Gazette, (2006); Report from Steward, Principal Industrial Registrar to Attorney General Latham, (1928); Letter from Garran, Secretary, Attorney-General's Department to C.

The government policy of offering workers a choice to bargain or to refrain from bargaining, in effect in countries such as the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, does not meet that standard. Just as the equity goal of governments is the absence of inequality based on traits such as sex and colour, the government bargaining policy goal should be universal collective bargaining.

However there has been far less attention paid to the evaluation of complementary and other non-price policies designed to accompany the carbon price. The purpose of this article is to develop a framework for considering the case for, and effectiveness of, the wide range of existing and proposed complementary policies that are designed to accompany the carbon price in the effort to reduce Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. The article concludes that an effective evaluation of complementary policies should include identifying the market failure the policy is aimed at correcting. The complementary policy should work in conjunction with, not opposition to, other polices aimed at reducing emissions. It should be complementary with the policies of other levels of government and it should also consider issues of efficiency, equity, accountability and adaptability.","Carbon pricing; Complementary climate change policies; Complementary policy evaluation criteria; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Market failure","","Budget Strategy and Outlook 2011-12, (2011); Securing a Clean Energy Future, (2011); Exposure Draft, (2011); National Climate Change Adaptation Framework, (2007); Principles for Jurisdictions to Review and Streamline their Existing Climate Change Mitigation Measures, (2008); Combet G., Green Light: Australia's Climate Future, Address to The Committee for Economic Development of Australia, (2011); Combet G., (2011); Tax Expenditures Statement, (2011); Denniss R., Macintosh A., Complementary or contradictory?

Asymmetries of responsibility, impact and capacity reflect historical and current development hierarchies. At the same time, the imperative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions perversely empowers high-emitting newly industrialising counties. As inter-state negotiations enter a new post-Kyoto paradigm involving emissions reductions for 'all Parties' to the UN climate change convention, relations between industrial and industrialising countries, and more broadly between North and South, are re-orientated. This article charts these relations through two decades of United Nations climate negotiations, arguing the need to secure emissions reductions across the industrialising world opens up new possibilities for climate justice.","Climate change; Development; Ecological crisis; Geopolitics; North-south relations; United nations","","Anderson J., Afterword: Only sustain the environment, ""Anti-globalization,"" and the runaway bicycle, Nature's Revenge: Reclaiming Sustainability in an Age of Corporate Globalisation, pp. 245-275, (2006); Baer P., Mastrandrea M., High Stakes: Designing Emissions Pathways to Reduce the Risk of Dangerous Climate Change, (2006); Bello W., Deglobalization: Ideas for a New World Economy, Zed, (2002); Bello W., The Environment Movement in the Global South: The Pivotal Fight Against Global Warming, (2007); Biel R., The New Imperialism: Crisis and Contradiction in North/South Relations, (2000); Watch C.T., The Carbon Neutral Myth: Offset Indulgences for Your Climate Sins, (2007); Poll Finds Worldwide Agreement That Climate Change is A Threat, (2007); Christoff P., Post-Kyoto?

These difficulties have been exacerbated during the recent period of intense 'globalisation'. The political embrace of neo-liberalism, de-regulation of labour and other markets, increased capital flows, interaction between national and regional economies, and innovation and growth of information and communications technology, have created a very different, and constantly changing environment for labour. Services work in particular is increasingly mobile as a result of huge developments in information and communications technology. The white collar service sector is thus creating a particular challenge for trade unions, as the developed world increasingly buys its services off-shore. This article examines the features, extent, and effects of white collar services off-shoring, before going on to examine the responses of trade unions to this phenomenon. It looks at action taken by a number of unions in the USA, Australia, Europe and India, as well as internationally, before drawing conclusions regarding appropriate directions for unions to follow.","","","(2005); (2004); (2006); (2006); (2006); (1998); Arthurs H., Labour law Without the State?, 46, 1, pp. 1-45, (1996); Arthurs H., Reinventing labor law for the global economy: The benjamin aaron lecture, Berkeley Journal of Employment Law, 22, 2, pp. 271-294, (2001); (2004); (2006); Badger T., (2004); Bain P., Taylor P., (2004); Bivens J., (2006); Braue D., (2006); Cassidy J., (2004); (2004); De Marchi S., (2006); Deare S., (2006); Dobbs L., (2004); (2004); Fairbrother P., Yates C., Trade Unions in Renewal: A Comparative Study, (2003); Fairbrother P., Williams G., Barton R., Et al., Unions facing the future: Questions and possibilities, Labor Studies Journal, 31, 4, pp. 31-53, (2007); Faux J., Flat Note From the Pied Piper of Globalization, (2005); (2004); Gordon M., Turner L., (2000); Hepple B., (2005); (2005); (2006); (2004); (2004); Jenkins C., (2006); Kirkegaard J., (2004); Masson R., (2007); (2005); (2006); (2005); (2005); (2006); (2005); Navin P.S., (2006); O'Brien R., The Varied Paths to Minimum Local Labour Standards, (2002); O'Neill V., (2006); Owens R., Riley J., (2007); (2005); (2005); Riley J., Peterson K., (2006); Shekhar K., (2005); Stern A., (2005); (2004); (2006); Van Wezel Stone K., Labour and the global economy: Four approaches to transnational labor regulation, Michigan Journal of International Law, 16, pp. 987-1028, (1995); (1996); (1996)","","","SAGE Publications Ltd","10353046","","","","English","Econ.

A central component of the OBA is its provisions aiming to streamline the enforcement of Ontario's Employment Standards Act (ESA). The OBA's changes to the ESA are an attempt to manage a crisis of employment standards (ES) enforcement, arising from decades of ineffective regulation, by entrenching an individualised enforcement model. The Act aims to streamline enforcement by screening people assumed to be lacking definitive proof of violations out of the complaints process. The OBA therefore produces a new category of 'illegitimate claimants' and attributes administrative backlogs to these people. Instead of improving the protection of workers, the OBA embeds new racialised and gendered modes of exclusion in the ES enforcement process.","Employment standards; Enforcement; Labour market regulation; Neoliberal racism; Ontario; Precarious work","","Agocs C., Osborne B., Comparing equity policies in Canada and Northern Ireland: Policy learning in two directions?, Canadian Public Policy, 35, 2, pp. 237-262, (2009); Armstrong P., The feminization of the labour force: Harmonizing down in a global economy, Rethinking Restructuring: Gender and Change in Canada, pp. 29-54, (1996); Befort S.F., Budd J.W., Invisible Hands, Invisible Objectives: Bringing Workplace Law and Public Policy into Focus, (2009); Belzer M., Sweatshops on Wheels: Winners and Losers in Trucking Deregulation, (2000); Brodie J., Reforming social justice in neoliberal times, Studies in Social Justice, 1, 2, pp. 93-107, (2007); Budd J.W., Achieving decent work by giving employment a human face, (2004); (2009); Prosperity restricted by red tape, (2010); CFIB welcomes Ontario's early steps to tackle the $11 billion 'red tape' monster, (2010); Cranford C., Vosko L.F., Conceptualising precarious employment: Mapping wage work across social location and occupational context, Precarious Employment: Understanding Labour Market Insecurity, pp. 43-66, (2006); Creese G., Racializing work/reproducing white privilege, Work and Labour in Tumultuous Times: Critical Perspectives, pp. 192-226, (2007); Crispino L., Ontario Chamber of Commerce Letter to William Short, Re: Bill 68, Open for Business Act, 2010, (2010); Diefenbach T., New public management in public sector organizations: The dark sides of managerialistic ""enlightenment, Public Administration, 87, 4, pp. 892-909, (2009); Dutil P., Saunders R., New approaches in achieving compliance with statutory employment standards, (2005); Proposed ESA Enforcement Strategy to Minister's Employment Standards Action Group, (2004); Fudge J., Reconceiving employment standards legislation: Labour law's little sister and the feminization of labour, Journal of Law and Social Policy, 7, pp. 73-89, (1991); Fudge J., Flexibility and feminization: The new Ontario Employment Standards Act, Journal of Law and Social Policy, 16, pp. 1-22, (2001); Fudge J., Vosko L.F., Gender and segmentation: The standard employment relationship in Canadian labour law, legislation and policy, Economic and Industrial Democracy, 22, 2, pp. 271-310, (2001); Fuller S., Vosko L.F., Temporary employment and social inequality in Canada: Exploring intersections of gender, race and immigration status, Social Indicators Research, 88, pp. 31-50, (2008); Galabuzi G.-E., Canada's Economic Apartheid: The Social Exclusion of Racialized Groups in the New Century, (2006); Giroux H., Against the Terror of Neoliberalism: Politics Beyond the Age of Greed, (2008); Goldberg D.T., Neoliberalizing race, Macalester Civic Forum, 1, 1, pp. 77-100, (2007); Goldberg D.T., The Threat of Race: Reflections on Racial Neoliberalism, (2009); Gorrie P., Focus falls on Rogers over ethics: Haven't been paid their work service workers say, Toronto Star, (2003); Gorrie P., Immigrants take a stand for money they earned: 63,000 owed $214 million, group says; Changes coming labour minister vows, Toronto Star, (2004); Gray G., The responsibilization strategy of health and safety: Neo-liberalism and the reconfiguration of individual responsibility for risk, British Journal of Criminology, 49, pp. 326-342, (2009); Jackson A., Work and Labour in Canada: Critical Issues, (2005);  parliament, no. 110 (18 Feb.), (2009);  parliament, no. 139 (23 April), (2009); McCallum R., Plunder downunder: Transplanting the Anglo-American labor law model to Australia, Comparative Labor Law and Policy Journal, 26, 3, pp. 381-400, (2005); Mirchandani K., Ng R., Coloma-Moya N., Maitra S., Rawlings T., Shan H., Siddiqui K., Slade B., The entrenchment of racial categories in precarious employment, The Shifting Landscape of Work, pp. 119-138, (2011); Mitchell E., The Employment Standards Act 2000: Ontario opts for efficiency over rights, Canadian Labour and Employment Law Journal, 10, 2, pp. 269-286, (2003); Modesitt N., Reinventing the EEOC, Southern Methodist University Law Review, 63, 4, pp. 1237-1278, (2010); Moore G., (2010); Morrow A., What price for law and order?

The advocacy of property rights in environmental management is taken further in the libertarian 'free market' approach and this 'privatisation' perspective is reflected in the growing use of property rights instruments in climate change policy. This article examines the efficacy of using economic instruments in the environmental context where 'market ecology' promotes the commodification of environmental 'goods' and 'bads' and their management by market forces. It argues that the pricing of 'nature' or its useful properties is a crude abstraction that implies ecological values can be alienated, but this is incompatible with the material and relational qualities of such values. The limits of this conceptualisation are further demonstrated through an examination of the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), a price and property rights instrument which enables private project developers in developing countries to produce carbon credits in order to offset greenhouse gas pollution in developed countries. The evident negative social and environmental effects flowing from implementation of the CDM reinforce the limitations of economic logic in the environmental context.","Clean development mechanism; Climate change; Commodification of nature; Environmental economics","","Netwerk A.-E., Et al., Open Letter: UK Government Must Withdraw Authorisation for Aguan and Lean CDM Projects Linked to Assassinations and Other Human Rights Abuses in Honduras, (2011); Anderson T.L., Free market environmentalism: Rethinking the way we think, CIS Policy Report, pp. 19-23, (1988); Anderson T.L., Leal D.R., Free Market Environmentalism, (1991); Arnsperger C., Varoufakis Y., What is neoclassical economics?

Some argue that this is appropriate because unions increase minimum wages, and economic theory shows that this will decrease employment and hence output. The Rudd government has signalled that it intends changing this anti-union bias, while at the same time restoring the role and coverage of minimum wages. This paper examines the arguments around these issues and concludes that neither side of the economic theory debate has delivered a knockout blow. The theoretical analysis is followed by a section looking at empirical evidence on the effects of deregulating labour markets. Again there is not complete consensus among the economics profession. However, both sides of the debate on the effects of labour market deregulation agree that strong minimum wage legislation does significantly reduce earnings inequality by increasing earnings at the bottom end of the distribution. The paper concludes that the increase in inequality consequent on labour market deregulation has adverse effects on the economy in the short run and disturbing longer run effects on society.","","","Guide to Collective Bargaining Notifications, (2007); Blinder A., The $5.15 question, New York Times, (1996); Brown C., Gilroy C., Kohen A., The effect of the minimum wage on employment and unemployment, Journal of Economic Literature, 20, pp. 487-528, (1982); Youth Wages, Employment and the Labour Force, (1983); Workplace Relations: Action Plan for Australia; Card S., Kreuger A., Myth and Measurement: The New Economics of the Minimum Wage, (1995); Dawkins P., A plan to cut unemployment in Australia: An elaboration on the five economists' letter to the Prime Minister, 28<sup>th</sup> October 1998, Mercer Melbourne Institute Quarterly Bulletin of Economic Trends, 1, pp. 48-57, (1999); Debelle G., Vickery J., The macroeconomics of Australian unemployment, Unemployment and the Australian Labour Market, pp. 235-265, (1998); (2008); Freeman R.B., Single peaked vs. diversified capitalism: The relation between economic institutions and outcomes, National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper 7556, (2000); Freeman R., Labour market institutions without blinders: The debate over flexibility and labour market performance, National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper, (2005); Hancock K., The future of industrial relations in Australia, The Economic and Labour Relations Review, 18, 2, pp. 7-14, (2008); Kaufman R., The effects of statutory minimum rates of pay on employment in Great Britain, The Economic Journal, 99, pp. 1040-1053, (1989); Keynes J.M., The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, (1936); Kriesler P., Keynes, Kalecki and the General Theory, A 'Second Edition of Keynes's General Theory, pp. 300-322, (1997); Kriesler P., Was Kalecki an ""imperfectionist?""

Structural explanations, typified by those relating to corporate governance, appear to be uncontroversial.

Instead, a collection of individually desirable objectives are bundled together to present an appearance, rather than a reality, of cause and effect.

It does this by allowing them to offer agreements that reduce or eliminate award or statutory entitlements, by making it harder for both workers and unions to contest management decisions, and by sidelining the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. It also seeks to ‘move towards’ a national system of regulation by providing that the majority of employers will be exclusively subject to federal rather than State regulation, at least for some purposes. Yet for all the radical nature of many of the changes, this is not the ‘big bang’ it might have been. Many features of the old arbitration system have been retained and there are genuine compromises at the heart of some of the changes. It also remains to be seen just how quickly employers will move to exploit the opportunities the new legislation offers, given its complexity, opposition from unions, and indeed the natural pragmatism or conservatism of many managers ’ and whether this will prompt further intervention by a government that appears uncomfortable with leaving it to employers to make their own choices. © 2006, University of New South Wales.

While a strong external labour market may be a sign of economic dynamism, very high turnover rates may indicate a failure of the sort of organisational attachment among professionals that is needed to foster organisational learning. Moreover a 'brain drain' from the country of Malaysian-educated engineers remains an ongoing concern. Although this phenomenon is popularly attributed to the 'job-hopping' propensities of young Malaysians, it is argued here that firms, through their human resource management (HRM) practices, have an important role to play in encouraging stronger rates of knowledge worker retention. The article reports on research findings indicating varying levels of organisational commitment by a sample of Malaysian engineers. It examines possible links between high turnover and HRM approaches that afford employees few other forms of voice than exiting the firm. Evidence is provided that employee participation in decision-making, particularly relating to training and development, and the perceived fairness of performance appraisal practices, contribute to feelings of perceived organisational support (POS), and that this sense of support influences engineers' commitment and thus turnover intentions. © 2012, The Economic and Labour Relations Review.","Commitment;

In this article we examine the rationale for the establishment of the AFPC, outline the structure and operational details associated with the AFPC and compare it with the UK Low Pay Commission. The creation of the AFPC presumes some failings of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission with respect to its safety net wage case deliberations. We attempt to identify what these failings were. Finally, we consider what the implications of the creation of the AFPC will be. On this point the establishment of the AFPC must be placed in a context of ongoing legislative change to welfare access and in the other major developments in the Work Choices legislation, especially the creation of the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard. © 2006, University of New South Wales.

Key features are a high degree of centralisation, high levels of unionisation, a tripartite approach to government decision making and a keen interest in employee participation. The last decade has seen the onset of more turbulent economic forces, moves to decentralisation and a shift in wage determination towards a greater role for enterprise bargaining. Several parallels with Australian experience are explored. A critical difference is that Nordic unions have escaped the significant falls in membership suffered by Australian unions. © 1994, University of New South Wales.

This paper provides the first ever baseline of data on the job search behaviour of Indigenous job seekers and how it compares to the job search of non-Indigenous job seekers.

Indigenous Australians rely disproportionately on friends and relatives as a source of information about jobs, although their networks tend to have less employed members, and therefore are less effective than non-Indigenous networks in securing employment. Non-Indigenous job seekers are also more likely to use more proactive search methods than are Indigenous job seekers. © 2005, University of New South Wales.

The literature, however, tends to overlook the implications of these reforms for employment relations in the public sector. This paper presents evidence from two major surveys from the mid-1990s that compare the impact of workplace change on Australian public and private sector workers. Public sector workers reported they were working more intensively, under greater stress and with less job security than private sector workers. They also reported that their satisfaction with their job, with management and with their work/family balance had declined to a greater extent than their private sector counterparts. These employee responses suggest, despite the assertions of public sector management reports to the contrary, that the NPM reforms in the Australian public sector have resulted in more intensive workloads, increased job-related stress and reduced job security for many Australian public sector employees in the 1990s. © 2001, University of New South Wales.

The negative consequences for workers forced into unemployment are well recognised. However, a growing body of evidence suggests there are also substantial, though less obvious, negative effects on workers who are retained. These effects may include impaired teamwork and productivity, damaged social networks and diminished social support, negative attitudes to work, elevated work-life conflict, a greater prevalence of negative health behaviours and impaired physical and psychological health. A cluster of behavioural and health effects observed amongst retained workers, described as ‘survivor syndrome’, is characterised by demoralisation, risk aversion, diminished organisational commitment and poorer health. These negative effects may be moderated to some extent by factors such as personality, gender, organisational level and age. A focus on more specific research questions and methodological refinements are likely to enhance future research in this area. © 2002, University of New South Wales.

Reasons for, and impacts of, this development are explored, and an argument is made for the role of industrial regulation in reconciling requirements for flexibility, security and equity in university employment. Responses to a large survey of casual academic and general staff suggest that this employment mode is a minority preference. Discrete groups of casual university staff, including those seeking university careers, those with other secure income sources, and students in transit to other careers, experience different forms and levels of insecurity and inequity. Appropriately targeted regulatory responses thus include criteria-based caps, a general staff conversion mechanism, a work value review, access to increments and service entitlements, and workplace representation rights. © 2004, University of New South Wales.

Though the Indian government prohibits employment of children in factories, there is no law to prohibit employment of children in family households, cottage industries and family owned agricultural fields or family businesses, and large numbers of children miss school to look after cattle, collect firewood or work infields, restaurants or quarries. The framers of the Constitution of India were aware of their responsibility towards children and a number of provisions were made to protect children. This article focuses on legislation since 1938, prohibiting the labour of children aged below fifteen years. Defects in the legislation and weak enforcement machinery have meant that children working in family-owned industries and agricultural fields continue to escape attention. The small earning of a child have been seen as a means of survival for a large number of families in India. The article is primarily a historical piece, tracing this regulatory failure through five decades of independence and freedom in which lives of children, born free but bonded for life in the largest democracy in the world. This paper will provide the basis for assessing the degree of change for children, as India becomes one of the world's fastest growing economies. © 2006, University of New South Wales.

The paper explores the extent to which economic impact studies are practically feasible and useful in relation to occupational health and safety legislation. Six studies of the same regulatory change, from four countries were analysed. The results of these studies ranged from a strongly negative to a significantly positive net present value, depending on the assumptions made. The factor which had the greatest influence on these differences was the way in which benefits are costed. It is shown that in the field of Occupational Health and Safety, economic analysis does not produce a single valid net present value or benefit to cost ratio on which a decision to legislate can sensibly be based. However the analysis can, if properly directed provide useful information on factors which will enable organisations to optimise their response to the regulation and authorities to introduce regulations in a way which does not bear with unreasonable weight on specific sectors of the community. © 1995, University of New South Wales.

There has been talk of a new phenomenon of ‘working poverty’, where incomes in a significant number of households fall below the poverty line even when family members are in paid employment. This paper examines the growth of working poverty in Australia from the beginning of the 1980s to the mid-1990s. The analysis suggests that the phenomenon of working poverty is real and has been growing. Low pay on an hourly basis does not in itself equal poverty, and the biggest increase in family poverty has been among employees not in low pay. Yet the proportion of low-paid workers who are also in poor families has grown considerably. In the light of these findings the paper discusses the possible impact of policy approaches such as tax credits and higher minimum wages. © 2000, University of New South Wales.

While it has been common to look at aggregate participation rate changes in terms of a weighted average over age groups this seems not to be the case for unemployment. We show in this paper that changes in the age composition of the labour force (driven mainly by changes in the age distribution of the population) has affected the aggregate unemployment rates in a systematic and, with hindsight, predictable manner. Amongst other things, we show that in the past decade or so, policy makers have benefited from a not inconsequential “free lunch” in that changes in the age composition of the labour force have been pulling the aggregate unemployment rates down below what it would otherwise be by around one percent of the labour force. We also show that this free lunch is now coming to an end. © 2003, University of New South Wales.

Many of those thrown out of work by TCF plant closures were women, older workers, and workers from non-English speaking backgrounds who would find it difficult to re-establish themselves in the labour market. The Hawke government provided a package of labour adjustment assistance designed to help the retrenched TCF workers find jobs in other industries. This paper examines the rates of participation by retrenched TCF workers in the TCF Labour Adjustment Package. Drawing on both statistical and case study evidence it explores the different take-up rates by different subgroups of retrenched TCF workers.

This paper traces the labour market experiences of a sample of 649 former Ansett Airlines employees in the first eleven months after the airline's initial closure. It reveals that many workers spent long periods in an employment limbo ’ officially ‘stood down’ but not retrenched ’ while waiting for their Ansett jobs to be resurrected under new ownership. During that time, many accepted fragmented, short-term placements in ‘bad’ jobs. After this initial period of uncertainty, however, many former Ansett employees found their way back to ‘good’ jobs ’ either in the aviation sector or in firms offering secure primary segment employment conditions. The uneven outcomes experienced by different groups of workers reflect the interconnections between workers' perceptions of their options, their attachments to Ansett, their age and household circumstances in the context of weak demand for their skills. The paper illuminates the ways in which the personal loyalties, social networks and work expectations developed within Ansett's rigid internal labour market shaped retrenched workers' job search, recruitment and re-employment outcomes. © 2004, University of New South Wales.

It is important to the work of securities analysts, their clients and their industry. Bassi, Lev, Mcmurrer and Sissfield (2001) suggest that non-financial insights, particularly human capital related insights, make up a large proportion of investment decisions. More rigorous qualitative human capital analysis can illuminate the working of an organisation in a way that primary financial data on its own cannot achieve need. A model for outlining the human resource drivers of sustainable human capital is introduced and discussed in response to this need. In essence, an integrated approach is needed for the purpose of making more transparent investment recommendations.

As those threats emerged more fully through Korea's democratisation process, the KEF responded to pressures to raise its profile, broaden its activities and sharpen its identity.

The review notes that teamwork interventions have changed over the last two decades and argues that this may be attributed partly to the popularity and influence of Japanese management approaches during the eighties along with changes to the industrial relations institutions. Team interventions associated with earlier sociotechnical and participant design approaches, undertaken in the seventies, concentrated on changing work and jobs as a way to address quality of work life concerns. In contrast, many Australian organisations which are presently implementing teams are linking them to broader organisational design issues, taking into account product flows, customer and supplier focus, product innovation and support systems. It is noted that later-style team interventions are linked closer to an organisation's strategic goals. © 1995, University of New South Wales.

One key aspect of this debate has been the extent and impact of extended work hours. In this paper we examine the effects of a flexitime system on excessive hours in a Queensland public service department. This study finds that, for some groups of workers, the introduction of the flexitime system directly contributed to the development of a long-hours culture. The long-hours culture developed as part of managerial prerogative and in the absence of adequate regulation. Our research also finds that employees reluctantly working long hours consistently reported negative effects on their working and non-working life. © 2005, University of New South Wales.

Using a simple model, where the employer has monopoly power in the product market, it is shown that an efficient collusive bargain struck between union and employer will benefit the consumer. This result holds under quite weak assumptions about the objectives of the union. Under not unreasonable assumptions about the nature of union objectives, the collusive bargaining outcome will be better for the consumer them removing the monopoly power of the employer while the monopoly power of the union remains. The implication for wages policy is that rather than proscribe collusive bargaining between a union and an employer with monopoly power, regulation should assist such bargaining as there are social benefits. © 1999, University of New South Wales.

Of distinctive interest is the conflictual situation, and on occasion violent confrontation, which has arisen between timber workers and conservationists. It is concluded that continuing conflict between timber workers and conservationists will, at best, simply displace the environmental problem of logging old-growth forests by the creation of another problem of inequitably distributed resources. Resolution of the conflict requires these two main players to achieve empathetic communication and a negotiated settlement - if, given their very different world views, it is feasible. © 1995, University of New South Wales.

It examines the background or context of the case, the claims of the parties, and the reasoning of the majority and minority in their respective decisions. The case reveals a widening gap in the income of workers. Those without bargaining power are falling behind in both real and relative terms, in the regulatory world of enterprise bargaining.

The article traces the demise of the first moderately interventionist National Training Reform Agenda, which union reformers played a role in shaping, through the increasing marketisation of training policy. Under the Liberal National Coalition, budget constraints and the short term interests of employers have increasingly driven training policy. The drift of policy is against the grain of prescriptions drawn from the international literature, which shows the need for interventionist measures to correct ‘market failure’, and to ensure adequate expenditure and the integrity of qualifications. © 2002, University of New South Wales.

It is argued that the official unemployment rate has fallen because of a decline in participation rates among older males since 1972, and a significant proportion of these can be accounted for by the increase in the percentage of males receiving the Disability Support Pension and the Mature Age Allowance. These males are considered the Labor Market Disabled, since the principal cause of them being on welfare is the weakness of the labor market in which they have traditionally found employment. The unemployment rate is then reconsidered after including the LMD into the calculation, producing a more pronounced hysteresis affect over successive business cycles. It is argued that active job creation programs are required to move these people from welfare to work. © 2001, University of New South Wales.

This article highlights the key aspects of the 2005 legislation affecting trade unions. The constitutional basis of the new framework for regulating registered organisations is considered, as it presents unions with the challenge to revisit the validity of their registration under Federal law or to ‘opt out’ of registration altogether. The new union ‘right of entry’ provisions provide employers with far greater scope to resist or limit unwanted union influence at the workplace. Amendments to the freedom of association ‘provisions will restrict unions’ capacity to engage in a range of tactics to support the collective representation of workers' interests, and limit their ability to block de-unionisation or individualisation strategies by employers. We conclude that the 2005 Act constitutes the most serious threat to Australian unions yet, but that the high-profile debate generated by the reforms, and the erosion of conditions which will inevitably follow for some workers, provide opportunities for unions to re-establish their relevance and reverse declining membership levels. © 2006, University of New South Wales.

The Prices Surveillance Authority has recently proposed a change in the way it conducts surveillance of prices from a cost based system to a price cap system. Price capping, as a form of regulation, has been used extensively in the UK and the US for some time. The article argues that the lesson of this international experience is that price caps may not be the answer to the traditional problems associated with cost based regulation and that price caps may have additional disadvantages, particularly incentives for under investment, although it may have some other advantages. Some alternative regulatory options are then examined, mainly involving modifications to both cost based and price cap regulation. © 1994, University of New South Wales.

It reduces the sense of collective identity among members, decreases the attraction of associations' traditional collective goods and increases the urgency and array of individual member needs while increasing the costs of servicing them. Decentralisation also threatens revenue as large companies, the financial backbone of associations, shift employment relations activities in-house. This weakens the attractions of membership with the risk that employer associations will retain only smaller, heavily dependent members. We discuss employer association attempts to meet these challenges while competing with commercial service businesses. Their strategic choices lie on a continuum between traditional membership-based organisational identity, with its roots in movement as well as organisation, and one that more closely approximates a business services firm. Associations experiment along this continuum as they develop strategy iteratively and the article identifies factors that help determine their choices. © 2004, University of New South Wales.

In Australia, the blueprint for reform of the social security system developed by the McClure Report is built around the notion of mutual obligation ’ the idea that those who receive support from government should be required to ‘give something back’. Public opinion is supportive of requiring mutual obligation of some groups of the unemployed, but it also supports the view that solving unemployment generally is the government's responsibility. Although welfare reforms introduced in the US and UK have reduced the welfare rolls, their impact on wages and the labour market must also be considered. If welfare reform in Australia is to avoid the low wages and extreme poverty that are features of the US, welfare reform will need to be accompanied by reform of the labour market. © 2001, University of New South Wales.

An overview of its origins and growth in Australia and overseas is followed by discussion of management issues. Organisational issues concern aspects of planning, implementation and operation. Issues for job sharers include finding an appropriate job share partner, maintenance of the job sharing relationship, protection of voluntary participation and preservation of pro rata benefits and other working conditions. A process for facilitating effective liaison between management, job sharers and trade unions is proposed. Job sharing is uncommon in Australia but may assist workers to balance work and family responsibilities or pursue interests outside work while avoiding many disadvantages of precarious work. For employers, it may facilitate retention of valued staff, reduce turnover, enhance recruiting or reduce staff costs. These propositions have not been rigorously tested, however, and avenues for future research are therefore explored. © 2002, University of New South Wales.

The main arena of activity in the labour market is within employing organisations. Therefore, whilst national and industry level labour market studies may shed some light on labour market trends, this paper suggests that analysis should also assess the impact of activity within firms. A case study is used to examine the link between the employment polices and practices of a firm in the metals manufacturing industry and the labour market position of its employees taking into account the firm's institutional context (award restructuring, enterprise bargaining, and an active union presence). The study finds that the firm's pursuit of flexibility in order to improve its cost and quality competitiveness is exacerbating and reproducing divisions within the workforce based on workers' attributes (sex, English proficiency and formal qualifications). Labour market explanation should include, if not begin with, the role of employers. © 1998, University of New South Wales.

However, by the end of this century tariffs for imports of most commodities will have been lowered to negligible levels. This paper briefly examines the history of the tariff and the changing structure of assistance to manufacturing in the 1980s and 1990s. As the tariff has been dismantled, a variety of alternative measures have been implemented. Thus, while the ‘old’ protectionism of tariffs on imports has been discredited, a ‘new’ form of protectionism ’ much to do with providing assistance for exports ’ has arisen to at least partially take its place. The protective effects of many of these measures is far less apparent and possibly more deleterious than the tariffs they replace. © 1994, University of New South Wales.

A fundamental failure to recognise the temporary nature of Japan's success led the Japanese to make ad hoc changes, which served largely to prop up the prevailing status quo. Inevitably, Japan's ability to sustain the level of growth required to maintain its economic system periodically faltered, before collapsing in the nineties.

It draws attention to a number of defensible alternative definitions of ‘the budget deficit’ - which may give conflicting indications of the direction in which the budget balance is moving. It then outlines some of the ways in which alternative measures for effecting a given change in the budget balance may have different effects on the principal objectives of macroeconomic policy. It is pointed out that even if a reduction in the rate of increase in government debt is in itself desirable, it is only after consideration of the costs and benefits of alternative ways of achieving that aim that one can logically decide what policy measures - and what consequent change in the deficit - are appropriate. An appendix draws on some simulations for the UK economy and for the OECD to illustrate how different measures having the same effect on the PSBR may have different relative effects on the various macroeconomic objectives. © 1995, University of New South Wales.

We argue that the power and purpose of all such bodies is multi-dimensional, historically contingent and spatially specific. The most illuminating studies conceptualise peak bodies as agents of mobilisation, with power delegated by affiliates, and of economic and political exchange, with power derived from a ‘structural coupling’ with the state and capital. However, there is a third possible peak body purpose: social regulation and, specifically, the regulation of labour and commodity markets. This was a conspicuous activity of the Barrier Industrial Council, underpinned by success in mobilisation and exchange and by ‘place consciousness’. Understanding the variety of potential power sources holds the key to explaining not only why some peak bodies command more power than others but also why there is so much variation in peak union focus and behaviour. © 2001, University of New South Wales.

The primary data source is ABS Construction Censuses. There has been significant change in the structure of production in the construction industry with a large decline in firm size and rapid growth of output and employment in the specialist sub-contractors segment. These changes are explained largely as a result of increased subcontracting and outsourcing by larger firms to smaller firms. The changes in firm-size and industrial structure have had an adverse effect on construction productivity; OH&S performance; skilled trade shortages and expenditures on innovation and R&D in the industry. © 2000, University of New South Wales.

The general arguments for privatisation are evaluated and found not to be universally applicable. There is no a priori argument in that all activities operate optimally in the private sector. Rather, the costs and benefits of each particular case need to be examined. This is then done with respect to airports. Firstly, the question of whether airports should be operated as networks or as individual optimizing entities is considered. It is shown that with respect to both pricing and investment decisions, efficiency requires retention of the network. Due to the nature of the product, the market will not deliver an efficient, competitive outcome. In this light the specifics of the Australian privatization proposals are examined, and found wanting. The case for privatization of airports is extremely weak. © 1996, University of New South Wales.

The study finds that restructuring has raised the barriers to employer investment in vocational training and is the principal cause of sustained skill shortages in the industry. Using the 1986 and 2001 Population Censuses and economic and labour force surveys, it examines the significant changes in the occupational, industry, firm size, educational attainment and demographic structure of employment in the industry that have occurred over the last two decades. The major drivers of change include: new technologies; evolving consumer tastes; an intensification of sub-contracting through the intra-industry division of labour; outsourcing of activities through the inter-industry division of labour; and reduced role of the public sector in the industry. The study also finds evidence that a large proportion of sub-trade vacancies are filled by qualified tradespersons. This finding has important implications for current strategies to address trade skills shortages. It is concluded that changes in industry and workforce structure which exacerbate the lack of employer investment in training are creating an industry which does not have the skilled people required to meet demands. © 2006, University of New South Wales.

We find that, on average, female single parents tend to experience poorer health outcomes, and exhibit more ‘risky’ health behaviours (particularly smoking), compared to adults in ‘two-parent’ families. Children in female single parent families tend to have more chronic health conditions than children in two-parent families. We also find that single parent families tend to spend a lower proportion of their income on health care, while receiving fewer indirect health care resources through government.

The capabilities included advanced manufacturing technologies (AMT), design, information and communications technology (ICT), biotechnology and environment technologies. Eighty-eight companies and organisations were interviewed for the study. It was found that the main requirements for the successful creation of a capability was the ability of the company to recruit and retain the best graduates from universities and technical schools, the ability to offer training to these graduates and the ability to financially support high and consistent levels of R&D over time. The main requirement for the successful use of a capability was effective company networking, work cultures conducive to excellence, supportive government regulations and the provision of complementary specialised training. © 2004, University of New South Wales.

After outlining the multiple uses of these forests, evidence is reviewed that suggests that subsidisation of logging is extensive. Next the paper reviews work that indicates that when account is taken of the environmental values lost due to logging (including the value of water with alternative uses) there are net social costs from logging high conservation native forests. Finally, changes to the structure of the wood products industry are analysed and it is argued that the growth of plantation timber, although rapid, has been constrained by subsidisation of native forests logging. Despite this, the data show that plantation-sourced wood will capture most of the market for sawn timber and pulp within a decade. There is thus the opportunity for Australia to have its timber needs met without the environmental costs associated with logging of native forests. © 1995, University of New South Wales.

Under this ‘autonomous enterprise'model, ‘genuine’ enterprise bargaining is supposed to produce comprehensive agreements which set terms and conditions of employment which are company-specific. The experience of enterprise bargaining in the Australian domestic airline industry is then compared with that model. It is found that, contrary to the model, the two major airlines have negotiated enterprise agreements which are remarkably similar, with wage increases and workplace reforms following strong industry-wide trends. The explanation offered for the lack of enterprise autonomy focuses on both institutional factors and structural features of the industry's product. © 1996, University of New South Wales.

Have these increases been excessive? There are a myriad of wage data series produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. These series reflect different questions and different perspectives about wages. In the context of the previously centralised wage determination process the dissection and analysis of aggregate wage series was an important exercise for industry and academic economists. However, the analysis and interpretation of aggregate wage data has become more difficult in the light of a number of developments: (a) falling award coverage, (b) the development and uneven spread of enterprise bargaining, (c) the industrial and demographic restructuring of the workforce, (d) the growth in non-wage benefits, (e) the growth in non-standard employment What are the available options for measuring aggregate wages growth in the light of these above developments?

The recent history of wages policy in Australia is analysed in terms of competing goals for wages policy and the changing priorities for these goals. The Living Wage Case decision is a continuation of developments in the Australian labour market that worsen the relative income position of the low paid, tend to create a two-tier wage structure, and worsen the prospects for reductions in unemployment because responsibility for the control of wage based inflation has been given to restrictive monetary policy. © 1997, University of New South Wales.

Approximately 42 per cent of undergraduate students are women but the percentage of women participating declines in postgraduate programs and in academic positions in economics departments, where approximately 26 per cent of academics are women. Female representation in the academic labour market has an importance beyond its numbers. A lack of female role models and mentors among academics is one factor that may affect students' motivation and career aspirations. We use the results of a national survey of Australian economics students to assess the relative importance of a number of factors in the career choices for postgraduate and undergraduate students in economics.

It argues that the Work Choices reforms have shifted power over the setting of minimum working conditions to the government, which will set many conditions directly, and to employers, who will be entitled to require employees to be party to workplace agreements that displace very many of the minimum working conditions that are otherwise purportedly guaranteed. These shifts have opened up the space for significant reductions in minimum working conditions, as well as for falls in real wages for those not able to benefit from wage bargaining. © 2006, University of New South Wales.

The study is based on ABS monthly gross flow data, disaggregated by gender, and with the employment status disaggregated into part-time and full-time work. The principal finding is that the somewhat surprising pattern, of counter-cyclical monthly flows from unemployment to employment, is primarily the result of counter-cyclical male transitions to full time employment. The results are compared with those from European empirical studies. The paper also considers the consistency of the results with thé implications of theoretical models which emphasise the counter-cyclical ‘quality’ of the unemployment pool. © 1997, University of New South Wales.

Using a case study analysis of six workplace injuries, this paper reports on the overall cost of work-related injury, and identifies the key determinants of cost.

In Australia evidence of the consideration of ‘sustainability’ goals in data collection and disclosure is growing through the development of ‘state of the environment’ reporting. The development of integrated environmental, economic and social information to support the application of more radical environmental modernisation ideas by organizations and governments is weak. Private and public sector organization reporting has improved, but there are still insufficient incentives to enhance it. This paper suggests more systematic reporting at the aggregate level by governments is essential if the environment is to be managed in a regular, balanced, sustainable and responsible way. © 2002, University of New South Wales.

While real disposable incomes increased across the distribution, income inequality has also increased since 1994–95, particularly between 1996–97 and 1999–2000. Over the entire period from 1994–95 to 2000–01, mean income in the top quintile increased by $111 a week, more than eight times the increase of $13 a week in the lowest quintile. Since the Howard government came to office, the estimates indicate that almost half (47.3 per cent) of the total increase in disposable income was received by those in the top quintile ’ implying that half of the income generated by economic growth has been of no benefit to the bottom four-fifths (in income terms) of the population. Comparison with earlier research also shows that income inequality has, in some respects, increased more rapidly since the mid-1990s than during the 1980s. © 2004, University of New South Wales.

Some advocate them to moderate wage inflation and thus complement macroeconomic demand expansion. For others, they are advanced as a second-best, but politically feasible, substitute for reducing real wages. For many, they are regarded as an equity measure to assist the very long-term unemployed. All these goals are macroeconomic, for the policy maker is interested in the number and type of people displaced from employment as a result of the labour market programs. However, despite this, the macroeconomic field of labour market program evaluations is surprisingly thin. Few direct measures exist in Australia and overseas on the aggregate employment effects of such programs and the inference from related works finds little consistent evidence that they increase aggregate employment. Furthermore, there is a lack of macroeconomic assessments of the equity effects. © 1999, University of New South Wales.

It also critically assesses the recent Productivity Commission (1999) report on the construction industry. In particular, the article challenges the argument of the Productivity Commission that a high level of unionisation within the industry is adverse for productivity growth. Moreover, the recommendations of the Commission directed at increasing productivity within the industry are argued to exacerbate those structural features of the construction industry which impose a constraint on productivity growth. The primary data sources are national and international official economic data on the industry and a number of case studies of major city building projects undertaken by the authors. The study finds that the Australian construction industry is within the top three OECD countries in terms of construction output per person employed. © 2001, University of New South Wales.

Included in this reform package were proposals for a Mediation Adviser to oversee the use of mediation in industrial relations. The paper critically examines these proposals. Data from a survey of WA practitioners indicates that the core elements of mediation are seen as self-responsibility and voluntariness which clearly distinguish it from the traditional processes of conciliation by the tribunal. However, there is also uncertainty over the nature of mediation and how it might operate in the context of, or as an alternative to, the present framework of dispute resolution. The government's package of reforms, including those relating to mediation, were withdrawn but the interest in mediation remains. This paper suggests that rather than creating a new industrial relations agency (the Mediation Adviser), making provision for mediation by Industrial Commissioners with the parties still able to choose private mediation if they wish would achieve the desired policy objectives. © 2000, University of New South Wales.

This model of ‘contract’ employment is one in which employees may be terminated at short notice, for no reason, and with very limited termination compensation. This paper analyses the consequences of this new model and, specifically, of dramatically increased exposure to the risk of arbitrary termination or termination flowing from the impact of an ‘exogenous’ financial or policy shock upon Government. It also reflects on the prospects for the construction of a new ‘implicit contract’ which might mitigate the adverse consequences of the new model by facilitating the re-establishment of trust in the public sector employment relationship. © 1996, University of New South Wales.

The simple model presented here derives from the labour market literature of internal labour markets and insider-outsider models. The net gains from outsourcing within this framework are assessed by comparing the cost saving from production synergies within the administrated internal labour market, with cost savings from exploiting relative wage differentials in the external labour market. This analysis seeks to identify the determinants of the magnitude of these cost savings and provide a framework to allow their assessment to contribute as one facet of the ‘make or buy’ decision. © 2005, University of New South Wales.

Though regarded by some as simply a vehicle for protectionism, the campaign for core labour standards is based on sound economics that extends the logic of trade regulation to the international dimension of labour. Getting agreement on core labour standards and enforcing them will be a difficult task, but one best conducted through the WTO using a joint ILO/WTO enforcement mechanism. It is argued that such a task will bring much-needed legitimacy to the WTO, and increase the chances that it can deliver a world of prosperous, open and fair trade. © 2002, University of New South Wales.

These support services included clinical areas such as, radiology, pharmacy and pathology, and non-clinical areas of catering and cleaning, engineering and environmental services. The impetus for this trend was the introduction of the Federal Government's National Competition Policy with its rationale that private sector pressures and competition would make the public sector more efficient. Through a case study approach, this paper discusses this process at two public hospitals, the aim being to investigate the reasons for outsourcing, outsourcing's interconnectedness with downsizing, and the implications at the workforce level. Workplace issues discussed include consultation between management, unions and employees, changes to employee numbers and work practices, maintenance of workplace conditions, implications for staff recruitment and retention, and the relative power of management and unions. It concludes that benchmarking, outsourcing and downsizing have all been used to bring about workplace change. Whilst the choice between processes may be dependent on management perception of the workplace environment, implications for the workplace from each process have been similar. © 2002, University of New South Wales.

Using multivariate analysis of survey data, it was found that sympathy towards unions was the most powerful influence upon union joining, but had little impact on union exit, which was more a function of the perceived instrumentality of membership. Employee perceptions on union in-fighting and cooperation with management influenced union membership, as did the outcome of involvement in industrial disputes. Satisfaction with union delegates was a key influence on attitudes and membership. Employee trust of management only influenced exit behaviour through its interaction with satisfaction with union delegates. Job satisfaction had a complex relationship with union membership that is disguised in aggregated studies. © 1998, University of New South Wales.

A crucial determinant of the proportion of new to old machines in any industry's stock of capital goods is therefore the level and rate of change of wages. The rate of accumulation not only has these supply-side effects; it is also obviously a major determinant of activity and employment. There is the possibility of a virtuous cumulative process. To achieve this, we need to make sure, that wages in all industries rise by amounts which are determined principally by the growth of overall productivity and the general price level. © 1997, University of New South Wales.

In seeking to explain why this outflow of capital took place and was so devastating for the countries concerned, various writers have laid blame upon a combination of connected lending, poor bank supervision, moral hazard and “crony capitalism”. Our emphasis is different. Much of the capital inflow financed a vast over-expansion of commercial real estate development. Plunging real estate values accompanied by severe difficulties in the banking and financial sector were common occurrences across the region. The argument we advance is that property plays a special role in banks' portfolios and that large international portfolio capital flows mediated by banks will usually lead to rapidly appreciating asset prices which will result in banking/currency crises. © 2004, University of New South Wales.

This paper highlights the existence of such a link, first in the labour-intensive phase of industrialisation from early 1960s to late 1970s, and then in the current phase of technology-intensive industrial development in Taiwan. However, established forms of inter-firm networks within and across the Taiwanese border have structural limitations to generate innovation from within the networks. This impedes further development of Taiwan's industries, in particular those which are more technology-intensive. Using the information technology industry as a case study, this paper examines the role of the state and the private businesses in fostering the formation of newer forms of inter-firm networks which contribute to Taiwan's further industrial development. © 1998, University of New South Wales.

With regard to the first question, we use shifts in the Beveridge Curve as a measure of changes in flexibility (following Solow). Shifts in the Beveridge Curve suggest that changes in the efficiency of labour market matching reflect the cyclical effects of hysteresis rather than the effects of labour market reform. With regard to the second question, we decompose changes in the output-employment ratio into structural effects, average hours effects, and residual factor intensity effects. We identify those sectors of the economy in which output per worker has increased significantly. © 2001, University of New South Wales.

Emery published a paper discussing the design of socio-technical systems for ‘greenfield sites’. In his paper Emery argued that a new and different paradigm of work, which is based on ‘co-operative, symmetrically dependent relations’, is more easily introduced into ‘greenfield sites’ and that ‘most matters can be negotiated beforehand with trade union officials’ (1980:19&21). In this paper the author explores the use of socio-technical design in a greenfield plant, and its application in an old, or brownfield plant of the same company. The socio-technical approach is embodied in the new production model being introduced, which is called a high commitment work system Of specific interest is the role of unions in the sites. Two questions are addressed in this respect. Are unions involved in the design and implementation of the socio-technical system? What are the implications for the future of the unions in these two sites?. © 1995, University of New South Wales.

This is the effect of the Work Choices exemption of corporate employers with up to 100 employees, the operational reasons exemption, the exemption of seasonal workers and the extension of the qualifying period from three to six months.

They are the Cole Royal Commission into the building and construction industry, bargaining fees and employee entitlements. The Cole Royal Commission was an inquisition into the heresy ofunionism. The decision ofa Full Bench ofthe Australian Industrial Relations Commission on bargainingfees has found that collective bargaining does not pertain to the employeremployee relationship. This decision encouragesfree-riding to weaken unions. On the other hand, various employee entitlement schemes, developed by the Australian government, to meet obligations of companies to employees when the former collapse, enable, or encourage, companies to free-ride on the backs oftaxpayers.

Drawing on evidence from the Australian entertainment industry, this study examines the more unusual case of an attempt to secede by elements of the leadership (rather than membership) from the Australian Theatrical and Amusement Employees Association. Following secession, the breakaway group merged with a different union. The paper argues that the country's system of industrial relations shaped the form of the breakaway and ultimately provided the legal vehicle for the disaffected group to split from its parent union.

However, these changes have been primarily concerned with income tax reform. Three areas of the tax reform remain outstanding - wealth taxation, State tax reform and commodity tax reform. Wealth taxation has proven a politically sensitive issue subject to little public discussion, a situation not helped by a lack of data on wealth distribution in Australia. State taxation has been the focus of more public debate through a number of Government funded reviews but despite this, few of these report's recommendations have been implemented. Although the issue of commodity tax reform has been the subject of considerable public debate, it too has resuted in no substantive reforms. This paper argues that until the political dimension of tax reform is taken more fully into account when designing tax reform proposals, the debate on these three tax issues will not move from words to legislation. © 1995, University of New South Wales.

The article traces the implications of these approaches for the pattern of growth and employment in both economies and also indicates their limitations. Ireland's approach is limited by dependence on foreign investment, embodying externally generated technologies, though this is now being addressed by a policy interest in R&D support and the development of industry clusters and networks. On the other hand, Australia faces growing and possibly unsustainable deficits in its current account, driven by imports of knowledge-intensive goods and services, notwithstanding recent improvements in the terms of trade associated with higher prices for primary commodity exports. © 2004, University of New South Wales.

This growth reflects the internationalisation of the agency business which, arguably, has come about due to demands for an ‘on-call just-in-time’ workforce. While temporary agency work possesses several conceptual and empirical challenges for researchers, it also poses challenges for regulators. This paper considers some of those challenges concerning various definitions, classifications and measurement of temporary work while comparing the Australian and Irish experience.

Critical to the return to work process is the provision by employers of suitable employment for workers following work related injury wherever this is reasonably practicable. This article emphasises the importance of employment security measures within the workers' compensation arena for both injured workers and the control of scheme costs. It highlights the precarious nature of employment security measures in Australian workers' compensation schemes due largely to the lack of enforcement, and the concomitant need for legislative and administrative reform. In doing so a number of specific reform proposals are put forward for discussion. In addition the nexus between employment security measures and the operation of the labour market is briefly considered. © 1998, University of New South Wales.

However, often there are associated costs, either unanticipated or unquantified. This paper provides evidence from two food processing companies to address the following questions: (1) Why do managers pursue outsourcing? and (2) Have managers anticipated and quantified the potential costs as well as the benefits of outsourcing? We conclude that while it seems clear that managers do begin with clear objectives for outsourcing and anticipate that benefits will flow, sometimes these objectives are not met, unexpected costs are incurred, or objectives change as new information is available or situations change. In other cases managers have been unable to objectively substantiate the outsourcing decision. © 2000, University of New South Wales.

We risk becoming a society of ‘rational fools’, where citizens value government services, but governments lack revenue to find them. Taxpayers see the system as unfair and see others dodge taxes; tax resistance increases, and the revenue base further declines. Rational behavior from an individual viewpoint is foolish from a communal perspective. Deficiencies in the tax system must be remedied to break the cycle. The inability to raise adequate revenue is fundamental. Federal/state financial imbalance is intrinsic to the problem and must be addressed. Removing opportunities for ‘tax shirking’, and addressing major inequities and concessions in direct taxes would improve prospects for indirect tax reform. Increasing overall progressivity by asset or inheritance taxes would balance regressive effects of indirect taxes. © 1997, University of New South Wales.

Losses to production and output from other sources are compared to those that result from industrial disputation. Australia's strike record is compared to that of other OECD countries. An explanation is developed concerning Australia's propensity for a high proportion of short strikes, and disputes which end with a resumption of work without negotiations. The article also explores reasons for the decline in the level of industrial disputation which occurred in Australia during the decade of the 1980s. © 1991, University of New South Wales.

It is argued that a corporatist bargaining structure has been reinstated as a pragmatic measure to handle a difficult economic situation. This is contrary to the general political sentiments which have prevailed since the beginning of the eighties. However, a new constellation of actors are emerging on the organisational level who may irreversibly change the bargaining structure. With regard to participation, the laws and institutions that were introduced during the 1970s are still in place. However, their content is changing from democratisation as a value by itself to a focus on productivity-improvement as the ultimate goal. © 1994, University of New South Wales.

The main case against the levy is that it will merely reshuffle the dole queue and, at the same time, create ‘artificial’ jobs at the expense of ‘real’ jobs.

This view is consistent with the traditional role of the Industrial Relations Commission and with the conclusions of the 1985 Hancock Report, which provided the rationale for a permanent regime of centralised wage-fixing in Australia. It is also supported to some degree by the results of the Australian Workplace Industrial Relations Survey, which show that, despite the accumulating pressure for change, most workplaces currently lack the necessary ‘infrastructure’ for bargaining and consultation at enterprise level. In particular, the failure of Australian management to involve workers and unions in change may be seen as a major impediment to further workplace reform. The fundamental question which arises for industrial relations policy is whether to accept the situation as it is and hope for progress through the slow but steady implementation of award restructuring, or whether to provide an external impetus for the development of a workplace infrastructure through the establishment of a new framework for enterprise bargaining combined with legislation to promote information-sharing and consultation at the workplace. The central thrust of this article is that the latter approach will more effectively foster a ‘strategic bargaining’ culture in Australia. © 1991, University of New South Wales.

Most of the theoretical and empirical works on this issue focus on the static or current macroeconomic performance in terms of employment and inflation and microeconomic efficiency resulting from enhanced labour market flexibility. Following Lancaster's work and subsequent extensions by Schott and Vartiainen, this paper regards wage bargaining as a dynamic game involving conflict over the distribution of current and future income. It is argued that the intertemporal decision makings of both workers and employers are influenced by so-called prisoners’ dilemma.

While economic growth will reduce the general level of unemployment, to return the long-term unemployed to work will require increased training and reduction of labour costs. More recently the concept of a ‘training wage’ whereby employers would be allowed to pay below the current award wage to previously long-term unemployed has received some support. The Green Paper did not give much attention to training wages, preferring instead to focus on wage subsidies.

In challenging the Government, the Commission, the ACTU and the airlines over the wage fixation guidelines the AFAP failed to take full account of the current industrial relations context. A successful attempt by the Federation to achieve increases outside the indexation buidelines in 1977–78 ever one of the significant examples of AFAP strength in past campaigns which may have led the Federation leadership to emulate previous strategies. The AFAP thus limited consideration of tactical options in 1989. Its reaction to legal action initiated by the airlines was to organise the mass resignation of members, weakening its bargaining position. Both US air traffic controllers in their 1984 dispute and the AFAP maintained inflexible courses, ignoring every opportunity to retreat and regoup in the face of major defeats. In contrast, Qantas pilots and Australian Air Traffic Controllers gained significant salary increases within the guidelines. Having lost exclusive coverage of pilots, the Federation's future may now be dependent on closer links with the trade union movement and amalgamation. © 1990, University of New South Wales.

It is argued that much of the welfare privatisation debate is overly simplistic and does not recognise the important role which the non-government sector already plays in aspects of support for the age. Analysis of income data shows, for example, that transfer income currently accounts for less than half of the income of the aged. The trend towards superannuation is apparent in the data, although some doubts are raised about the impact of superannuation expansion on the finance of population ageing. In the area of community services, the paper describes the development of policy over the last few decades in order to illustrate the complexity of existing arrangements. The switch from institutional to community care is identified as a major trend, particularly during the 1980s, and some of the implications of this development for privatisation are drawn out and analysed. © 1992, University of New South Wales.

It has been argued that natural resource accounting is needed, and that national income accounting conventions need modifying. The paper reviews this background and argument, and distinguishes several types of natural resource accounting. It is noted that adjustment of measures of national income requires valuation, and that with respect to sustainability objectives market and surrogate market prices are inappropriate. It is argued that the pursuit of sustainability requires modelling rather than historical accounting. Some recent, unofficial, attempts at revising national income data to reflect sustainability concerns are critically reviewed. Finally, data requirements for ecological sustainability are considered. © 1991, University of New South Wales.

The most striking exception to this appeared in the first issue of this journal where Costa and Duffy argued that amalgamation plans were ‘fatally flawed’. This perspective, although drawing out some problems with the ACTU's program, is itself unsatisfactory because too much of its argument remains implicit and it relies on highly debatable assumptions. Like so much industrial relations debate in Australia, the arguments in and about union strategies are made more difficult because they proceed without reference to theory or history.

On the side of indirect tax the replacement of the wholesale sales tax by a broadly based value added tax is highly desirable, but is unlikely to be achievable politically unless lpart of a strategy which combines sales tax reform, tax mix change and income tax reform.

The reasons for this decline are located in structural problems relating to the decline of the industrial sector and the increasing unreliability of the export sector. We view industry as the core sector which generates technology and growth. Within the industrial sector, capital goods producing industries are the ‘hot bed’ (so to speak) of structure change and technical progress. Australia has let these industries decline. As a result, traditional remedies in the form of either demand management policies or ‘waiting for the world recovery’ will not be enough. In fact, recent economic policies, rather than being a panacea, have exacerbated the problem. © 1991, University of New South Wales.

(APPM) dispute which took place in Burnie, Tasmania between March 3 and June 10, 1992. The dispute is placed within the context of major changes in Australian industrial relations, which have been in process since 1986. Management and unions throughout Australia are still experimenting with a variety of industrial weapons to achieve their aims and goals within the parameters of the “Structural Efficiency Principle” and “enterprise bargaining”, constructed in Accords III through VI, from 1986 to the present. It is argued that the crucial change during the past six years has been the ability of companies to re-establish managerial prerogative through litigation. This has provided management with the power to confront secondary issues and agents of change such as the Accord, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, Structural Efficiency, Enterprise Bargaining and Restructuring with a new vigour, toughness and effectuality. Increasingly docile, debilitated and legally disabled union officials and workers seem to be coming to the view that a union victory occurs if the company agrees to abide by the law while directing its workforce, and recognises the workers' right to be represented by a “third party”. © 1992, University of New South Wales.

The trade union movement's strategy for the 1990s has been formulated within the protective umbrella of the Accord. The trade union movement has both a vision of the future and an ambitious set of strategies aimed at securing its position within Australian society. The key challenge facing the movement is the reversal of the decline in trade union participation rates. Trade union amalgamation leading to the creation of 20 large efficient union federations will generate scale economies which will free up resources for recruitment campaigns and additional services. The strategy of the trade union movement requires critical examination in the light of structural changes to the economy, the diversity of the labour market and new management approaches to human resource management. These factors require that unions adopt a number of diverse strategies to secure the future of the union movement. New and more decentralised union structures may be required to unionise workers in non-traditional areas. The union movement needs to constantly review its strategies to ensure they remain relevant to changing realities. © 1990, University of New South Wales.

The article situates Jobsback in the context of the evolution of the coalition's industrial relations policies since the Fraser years, outlines its major features, and provides a critique. Jobsback erects a new regulatory schema under a banner of deregulation. Three key elements are contained in Jobsback. They are tribunal avoidance and the use of the common law, legislatively imposed employment rules to ‘aid’ the transition from an award to a non-award system, and enterprise confinement. The article draws attention to the coalition's views concerning industrial conflict, constitutional issues, transitional problems associated with establishing legislatively imposed workplace rules, minima in workplace agreements, the Office of the Employee Advocate, equality before the law and good faith bargaining. © 1993, University of New South Wales.

Rising unemployment and the increased incidence of sole parenthood have put more children at risk of poverty, a development which has prompted increased policy concern. This paper presents estimates of the incidence and structure of poverty in Australia in 1981–82, 1985–86 and 1989–90, using the poverty standard developed by the Poverty Commission in the seventies. The estimates for 1989–90 are based on data generated from the 1986 Income Distribution Survey by a microsimulation model that allows for trends in demographic change, labour market participation and income during the second half of the eighties. The results indicate that the overall poverty rate has increased from 9.2 per cent in 1981–82 to 12.8 per cent in 1989–90. This is despite the fact that the incomes of many low income groups have increased in real terms, in many cases substantially. The reason for this apparent paradox is that the poverty standard is a relative one, and has thus itself been increased in line with average community incomes. One of the conclusions of the paper is that it may be necessary to reconsider the use of a relative poverty standard when assessing short-run trends in the extent of poverty. © 1991, University of New South Wales.

Government expenditure should be determined by longer term aspirations. Taxation (and other revenue measures) must be used, along with monetary policy, for short-term economic management, but whether revenue should be at a level that results in a deficit or not depends on many things including the composition of government expenditure and the state of the economy. At present, our economy requires a brake on total consumption expenditure and this may require a rise in taxation levels despite the high current level of unemployment. A high rate of capital accumulation is essential to change the structure of production and to increase output and productivity, but the brake on consumption must be eventually relaxed. Without an expectation of healthy consumption growth there will not be an ongoing high rate of accumulation in the private sector. © 1993, University of New South Wales.

This restructuring, with its potential to facilitate a better skilled, more flexible and more efficient workforce is integrally related to the National Wage determining process and the ACTU-ALP Accord. It is also a key to international competitiveness and the wellbeing of the manufacturing sector. In recent years the wage determination process has attempted to reduce those normative forces which industrial tribunals have institutionalized — in particular comparative wage justice and real wage maintenance. This attempt has created a number of tensions: control versus flexibility; cost of living versus productivity; centralism versus decentralism; paid rates versus minimum rates; supplementary payments versus over award payments; equity versus efficiency. The system's capacity to resolve these tensions without merely returning to established wage settlement practices will determine the efficacy of the restructuring exercise. It will also shape the contours of industrial relations for the next decade. © 1990, University of New South Wales.

Initially this increase was masked by the increased number staying on in the education system and the resultant drop in the participation rate for the under 20 age group. It is contended that the compression of youth/adult wage relativities since the 1970s has affected both the demand and supply for young workers. Demand has dropped since the experience premium attached to adult wages has been reduced. In the context of unemployed adult workers, the latter will be preferred to younger workers and new entrants to the labour market. On the supply side increased relative wages have induced more young workers into the labour force, increased the participation rate for this age group, and thus further increased the rate of unemployment. The persistence of this problem over time has given rise to relatively high levels of long-term youth unemployment Policy options to remedy this social and economic problem are necessarily constrained. On the industrial relations front a constraint is trade union antipathy to youth wage reduction policies which could give rise to generalised wage reductions. This paper proposes the extension of the special provisions of awards which permit for reduced payments as a means of assuaging union concerns. © 1994, University of New South Wales.

Such programs can help to improve the matching of labour supply and demand, reduce wage inflation pressures generated where labour markets are subject to supply shortages and bottlenecks, assist disadvantaged labour market participants obtain employment, help reduce poverty and income inequalities generated by the persistence of long-term unemployment, and they can raise overall productivity levels and living standards. What is at issue is not the need for LMP, but the type and mix of LMP required in Australia. The government has embarked upon a substantially supply side orientated LMP aimed at improving the employment prospects of the unemployed. On the demand side this has been augmented by a private sector wage subsidy program (JOBSTART). Such a mix of LMP is inappropriate for addressing the labour market problems associated with a recession. The government should, as a matter of urgency, consider the immediate introduction of a public sector job creation scheme (PSJCS). The advantages of such a program include its potential to directly address the problem of long-term unemployment (LTU), assist disadvantaged communities and provide an effective work experience support for the plethora of supply side LMP. Such a program could be effectively delivered by utilising the existing administrative structures of the CES and local government. © 1992, University of New South Wales.

Since 1983 wages policy has been implemented under a process which requires consistency between the principles under which the Industrial Relations Commission determines National Wage Case adjustments, and the elements of successive Commonwealth Government/ACTU Accords. The 1991 decision represents a rejection by the IRC of the thrust of the Government's wages policy as presented in Accord V1. It is argued here that it is the shift in the primary goal of wages policy, from control of inflation to the promotion of allocative and operational efficiency, which has provoked the crisis. Unlike the Government, the IRC was not prepared to abandon control over the aggregate wage outcome in the pursuit of the uncertain productivity benefits of enterprise bargaining. © 1991, University of New South Wales.

Firstly, there is research which seeks to monitor and evaluate the specific effects of specific policies, such as those that are expected to result from the proposed Job Compact. Secondly, there is the more general research agenda on the operation of labour markets in Australia, which help to shed light on issues of relevance to policy decisions. Thirdly, there is a broader research agenda on issues associated with productivity, competitiveness and economic growth, bearing in mind the importance of a substantial and sustained increase in the underlying rate of economic growth.

The findings offer strong support for the model because the same distinct strands of core motivation and remainder attitudes were evident. This demonstrates that the model could be successfully applied in a different institutional, cultural and economic context. The major cross-national differences to emerge were that most Dunedin youngsters intended to join a union; for them, collective instrumental reasons were very important and values of little significance. Furthermore, there was little evidence of disinterest or ignorance amongst the minority which was negative towards trade union membership. A recent article on trade union membership (Cregan and Johnston, 1990) suggested that conventional neoclassical theories are flawed by the free rider paradox, whereby a rational individual will not bear the costs of joining a union to gain rewards that are available to all the workforce as public goods. It proposed that the dilemma could only be solved by a membership theory which takes into account several different sources of individual motivation drawn from several disciplines. These were identified in a longitudinal survey of London early school-leavers, 1979–1981, in reasons given by young people for their membership decision, positive or negative, from which employees could be categorised in social movement parlance as core and remainder. However, the authors proposed that further direct investigations should be made in different contexts. For example, it may be that some responses were culturally or institutionally specific, or were based on economic context. Accordingly, a similar survey of a single cohort of early school-leavers was carried out ten years later in Dunedin, New Zealand. The aim of this paper, therefore, is to test the validity of the framework of the model within a different national context. The article will be organised in the following way. First, a brief summary of the Industrial Relations model of trade union membership will be presented and two hypotheses will be drawn from it. Second, the latter will be tested by a discussion of the results of the Dunedin survey and a comparison with those of the London survey. Third, implications of the findings for the consequences of the 1991 Employment Contracts Act will be briefly examined. © 1992, University of New South Wales.

In different industries and enterprises these principles have resulted in differing outcomes and approaches. In some industries, such as the chemical, steel and aluminium industries, restructuring has taken place at a company and/or enterprise level. In other industries such as metal fabrication, road transport, building and construction, a “blue-print” industry approach has been adopted.

These are then evaluated, making use of a simple conceptual framework. The analysis indicates that each system has its advantages and disadvantages, its supporters and critics.

On the other hand, the Green Paper is rich in policy suggestions to reduce long—term unemployment and to improve the working of the labour market. The Job Compact is central but improvements to social security and education and training are also important. © 1993, University of New South Wales.

This effect comes about in two main ways. The replacement ratio will influence both the rate of inflow into unemployment and the period for which people remain unemployed. The empirical evidence supports these propositions although the sensitivity of unemployment to changes in the replacement ratio is fairly weak. In the light of equity considerations reducing unemployment benefits as a policy weapon to counteract unemployment is thus not a viable option.

The proportion of self employed in the workforce will also increase and most people will work on contracts rather than be guaranteed long-term employment with one organisation. Few people will pursue the same occupation throughout their working lives. Retraining will become a constant requirement to ensure that skills remain relevant. While the latest technologies will continue to be used in order to maintain a high standard of living, there will be pressures on industry and governments to retain some labour intensive forms of work in order to contain levels of unemployment.

The conclusion from this evidence is that a switch from income tax towards indirect taxation tends to increase the price level, the rate of inflation, the current account deficit, and the public sector borrowing requirement, and to reduce the country's net wealth, at any given level of real GDP. One especially important conclusion is that the increase in inflation is significantly due to the cut in income tax, and not only to the effects of the rise in indirect taxation; and that the effects on inflation of the cut in income tax tend to last longer than those of the rise in indirect taxation. If the government of the country making the switch in taxation tries to hold down the consequently higher inflation and the rise in the current account deficit by reducing economic growth, the adverse economic effects will be correspondingly greater — and this appears to be what happened in both Britain and New Zealand, the two OECD countries that have made a marked shift in tax structure in this direction over the past decade. © 1992, University of New South Wales.

This highlights the need for state welfare and income taxation reforms to target those elements of income taxation and social welfare interaction that are most significant for high EMTRs and for high EMTRs extending across wide incomes ranges. Proposed welfare changes involve simultaneous reductions in base-level state welfare transfer payments, along with eligibility for supplementary transfer payments for able persons that are proportional to market labour activity. Proposed taxation changes include removal of distinctions between taxable and tax-exempt state welfare transfers and a gradually-progressive revised taxation scale. © 1992, University of New South Wales.

This paper argues the case for a different policy reorientation to what has been followed in the past. The first conclusion is that in the absence of a substantial reorientation of policy long term unemployment will remain very high, with the absolute number staying above the level inherited from the 1982/83 recession — which was until the current recession the highest in Australian history. Second, the equity and macroefficiency costs of not doing anything radically different are argued to be very high. A final part of the analysis considers the fundamental challenge of the Job Compact policy suggestion made in the Government's Green Paper on unemployment. However, the way in which the policy is to be instituted needs attention. It is likely that the use of the current JOBSTART wage subsidy scheme will not be enough to achieve the desired outcomes. © 1993, University of New South Wales.

Deregulation has forced interest rates to become the main focus of monetary policy. But, since the deregulation of financial markets, the transmission mechanism by which interest rates affect the economy, has changed significantly. © 1990, University of New South Wales.

One version sees enterprise bargaining as an add-on process, with the existing bank of awards retained, and trade unions playing a central and protected role. Another version sees enterprise bargaining as an holistic process, wherein all terms and conditions of employment can be negotiated subject to some minimum conditions. Trade unions may play some role, but not to the exclusion of other bargaining agents. Add-on enterprise bargaining may have only a small impact on productivity; there is a danger that wage (and price) inflation could increase; and the impact on employment is uncertain. Holistic enterprise bargaining is likely to have a more substantial impact on productivity; is unlikely to lead to inflation; and employment growth should be boosted. However, power-reducing policies and the abolition of awards are necessary correlates of holistic enterprise bargaining. © 1993, University of New South Wales.

If expenditures are unresponsive to changes in interest rates it is shown that the monetary authorities have the ability to determine the interest rate but if the authorities attempt to push interest rates into regions in which expenditures become interest rate elastic, a role for liquidity preference in determination of the interest rate is restored. This limits the effects of discretionary monetary policy to the short-term. Previous empirical studies, graphs and correlation coefficients indicate only limited evidence for a negative association between interest rates and changes in economic activity whereas Granger causality tests indicate that predictable relationships between interest rates and economic activity have existed in Australia for the period in which financial markets have been deregulated. © 1993, University of New South Wales.

Australia also appears to have, at present, an excessively—low rate of saving. In contrast to the views of the “minimalists”, who argue that government macroeconomic policy should not be adjusted to offset high rates of unemployment, it is argued in this paper that a policy for recovery is desirable. This argument is based on empirical evidence which suggests that the degree of price flexibility required for the economy to return automatically to full employment does not exist. The appropriate policy for recovery, given the low rate of saving, is an expansionary monetary policy. Indicators of monetary policy do suggest that the current stance of monetary policy is indeed expansionary. It is difficult to say whether an even more expansionary monetary policy should be adopted. © 1993, University of New South Wales.

There have been changes in the structure of industry and the workforce, and changes in arrangements under which work is performed. There is emerging a secondary or marginal labour market in which both full-time and casual, temporary and part-time workers are confronted with a situation where they are required to decide whether or not to enter work arrangements geared to the flexible organisational needs of the business enterprise rather than their own needs. Tensions between employer demands for flexibility, and for a largely unregulated use of the workforce, and employee concern to ensure job security and minimal protection in employment (including health and safety) means that employment law today has to respond to organizational relationships in determining whether or not to intervene between the parties to new work arrangements. The question is whether or not the principles of traditional employment law are flexible enough to become the legal framework of a technological society. © 1990, University of New South Wales.

The new agreements will have the status of awards but will not be within the purview of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC).

It begins with a discussion of data collection methods, pointing out some strengths and weaknesses of survey, case study, and agreement text analysis methods. It then focusses upon two substantive issues to test the success of research. The first concerns the infrastructure for enterprise bargaining. Our conclusion is that research illuminates this topic, and reveals general unreadiness. The second issue is productivity performance and enterprise bargaining. We are far more sceptical that research has proved a relation between the two. We conclude with the observation that researchers may be on the wrong track if they try to quantify the effects of enterprise bargaining on productivity performance. The paper recommends that greater attention be given to change management programmes designed to increase competitiveness, and to the outcomes sought from these, rather than to productivity. © 1994, University of New South Wales.
